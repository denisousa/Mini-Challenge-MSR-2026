### What changes are proposed in this pull request?

This PR refactors the clint linter's rule system by splitting the large `rules.py` file (559 lines) into a modular structure with one rule per file.

**Changes:**
- Split `dev/clint/src/clint/rules.py` into individual rule files in `rules/` directory
- Moved base `Rule` class to `rules/base.py`
- Created `rules/utils.py` for shared utility functions
- Updated `rules/__init__.py` to export all rules for backward compatibility
- Removed unnecessary class-level docstrings from rule files

**Benefits:**
- Improved modularity: Each rule is completely self-contained
- Better maintainability: Easy to add/remove/modify individual rules
- Cleaner file structure: Clear naming convention matches rule names
- Better git history: Changes to individual rules don't affect others

### How is this PR tested?

- [x] Existing unit/integration tests (backward compatibility maintained)
- [ ] New unit/integration tests (not needed for refactoring)
- [x] Manual tests (verified imports work correctly)

The refactoring maintains full backward compatibility - existing code using `from clint import rules` continues to work unchanged.

3223924413,62941,fix: correct file ownership in java-connector-base Dockerfile,"## Summary

Fixes file ownership issue in `java-connector-base` Docker image that was causing connector `spec` command failures.

## Problem

The java-connector-base:2.0.3 image was failing with error:
```
[dumb-init] spec: No such file or directory.
```

**Root Cause:** The `ADD` commands in the Dockerfile were downloading files as `root` user, overwriting the previously set `airbyte:airbyte` ownership. This meant the `airbyte` user couldn't access the required scripts.

**Investigation Results:**
- ✅ java-connector-base:2.0.1: Files owned by `airbyte:airbyte` (works)
- ❌ java-connector-base:2.0.3: Files owned by `root:root` (fails)

## Changes

1. **Added ownership fix after ADD commands** in `docker-images/Dockerfile.java-connector-base`:
   ```dockerfile
   # Fix ownership and permissions after ADD commands
   RUN chown airbyte:airbyte /airbyte/base.sh /airbyte/javabase.sh /airbyte/dd-java-agent.jar && \
       chmod 750 /airbyte/base.sh /airbyte/javabase.sh
   ```

2. **Reverted source-snowflake back to 2.0.1** until 2.0.3 is fixed

## Test Plan

- [x] Verified file ownership differences between 2.0.1 and 2.0.3 images
- [x] Confirmed the root cause through container inspection
- [ ] Build and test the corrected image
- [ ] Verify spec command works with airbyte user

3268208096,16909,Remove D417 from Ruff lint rules (duplicate with clint),"The `D417` rule (undocumented-param) was enabled in both Ruff and our custom linter (clint), causing redundant warnings and maintenance overhead. This PR removes the duplication by:

1. **Removing D417 from Ruff configuration** - Deleted `""D417""` from the `select` list in `[tool.ruff.lint]` section of `pyproject.toml`

2. **Cleaning up suppression comments** - Removed `# noqa: D417` comments from 32 files across the codebase while preserving:
   - Other noqa codes in multi-code comments (e.g., `# noqa: F401, D417` → `# noqa: F401`)
   - All existing `# clint: disable=missing-docstring-param` comments

The custom clint linter will continue to enforce parameter documentation requirements through its `missing-docstring-param` rule, maintaining the same code quality standards without duplication.

**Before:**
```python
def example_function(param1, param2):  # noqa: D417
    """"""Function with missing param docs.""""""
    pass
```

**After:**
```python  
def example_function(param1, param2):
    """"""Function with missing param docs.""""""
    pass
```

Fixes #16908.

</details>

Now that Python 3.9 support has been dropped (confirmed by `requires-python = "">=3.10""` in pyproject.toml), we can import `ParamSpec` from the built-in `typing` module instead of `typing_extensions`.

This PR makes the following minimal changes:

1. **Remove `ParamSpec` from typing-extensions-allowlist** in `pyproject.toml` - Since `ParamSpec` is available in the standard library starting from Python 3.10, it no longer needs to be in the allowlist for typing_extensions imports.

2. **Update import in `mlflow/utils/annotations.py`** - Change from `from typing_extensions import ParamSpec` to importing it directly from the standard `typing` module.

The changes are backward-compatible since MLflow now requires Python 3.10+, where `ParamSpec` is natively available in the `typing` module. All existing functionality continues to work exactly as before.

Fixes #16910.

This PR updates the `.github/actions/setup-python/action.yml` file to modernize Python version support by removing deprecated Python 3.9 and adding Python 3.11 support.

## Changes Made

**Updated `.github/actions/setup-python/action.yml`:**
- Removed Python 3.9 support (previously 3.9.13 for Windows, 3.9.18 for Linux/macOS)
- Added Python 3.11 support with version 3.11.8 for both Windows and Linux/macOS platforms
- Updated error message to reflect new supported versions: ""Must be '3.10', or '3.11'""

**Updated `.github/workflows/slow-tests.yml`:**
- Changed explicit Python version from 3.9 to 3.10

## Validation

The changes have been tested to ensure:
- Python 3.10 and 3.11 are properly handled with correct version mapping
- Python 3.9 and other invalid versions are correctly rejected with updated error messages
- Existing workflows using the setup-python action without explicit versions continue to work (using default 3.10 from `requirements/python-version.txt`)

This aligns with the project's current minimum Python requirement of 3.10 as specified in `pyproject.toml` and removes support for the deprecated Python 3.9.

Fixes #16912.

3108861090,16007,Remove unused `.github/workflows/sync.py` file,"This PR removes the unused `.github/workflows/sync.py` file that is no longer referenced by any GitHub Actions workflows.

## What was removed

The `sync.py` script was designed to automatically sync the `mlflow-3` branch with the `master` branch by:
- Creating PRs to merge master changes into mlflow-3
- Handling merge conflicts and branch management
- Automatically requesting reviews

## Why it can be safely removed

- No GitHub Actions workflows reference or execute this script
- No scheduled workflows or other automation uses this file
- The functionality appears to have been replaced with manual sync processes (documented in `sync.md`)

## What remains

The `.github/workflows/sync.md` file with manual sync instructions is preserved, as it may still be useful for manual branch synchronization processes.

Fixes #16006.

3108908027,16009,Replace `dev/check-notebooks.sh` with `clint` rule for trace UI detection,"This PR replaces the standalone `dev/check-notebooks.sh` script with a proper `clint` rule that integrates seamlessly with the existing linting infrastructure.

## Changes Made

1. **Added new rule**: `ForbiddenTraceUIInNotebook` (MLF0022) in `dev/clint/src/clint/rules.py` that detects the presence of MLflow Trace UI iframe content in notebooks
2. **Updated linter**: Modified `lint_file()` function in `dev/clint/src/clint/linter.py` to check for the forbidden trace UI pattern in `.ipynb` files
3. **Removed shell script**: Deleted `dev/check-notebooks.sh` 
4. **Updated pre-commit config**: Removed the `check-notebooks` hook from `.pre-commit-config.yaml` since `clint` already processes `.ipynb` files

## Functionality

The new rule detects notebooks containing `static-files/lib/notebook-trace-renderer/index.html` and provides the same helpful error message as the original script:

```
Found the MLflow Trace UI iframe in the notebook. The trace UI in cell outputs will not render correctly in previews or the website. Please run `mlflow.tracing.disable_notebook_display()` and rerun the cell to remove the iframe.
```

## Testing

The implementation correctly handles:
- Notebooks with trace UI content (triggers MLF0022 violation)
- Clean notebooks (no violations)
- Edge cases like notebooks without cells
- Integration with existing clint rules and pre-commit hooks

## Benefits

- **Consistency**: Uses the same linting infrastructure as other rules
- **Maintainability**: Single codebase instead of separate shell script
- **Integration**: Works with existing `clint` ignore mechanisms and tooling
- **Performance**: No additional pre-commit hook needed

Fixes #16008.

3109263417,16014,Support string guidelines for `meets_guidelines` judge,"The `mlflow.genai.judges.meets_guidelines` function was documented to accept both single strings and lists of strings for the `guidelines` parameter, but the underlying `databricks.agents.evals.judges.guideline_adherence` function only accepts lists. This caused runtime errors when users passed a single string guideline.

## Changes Made

1. **Fixed `meets_guidelines` function**: Added logic to wrap string guidelines in a list before passing to the underlying databricks judge
2. **Enhanced test coverage**: Added comprehensive tests in `test_guideline_adherence` to verify both string and list input scenarios work correctly

## Example Usage

Both of these now work correctly:

```python
from mlflow.genai.judges import meets_guidelines

# Single string guideline (now works!)
feedback = meets_guidelines(
    guidelines=""Be polite and respectful."",
    context={""response"": ""Hello, how are you?""}
)

# List of guidelines (already worked)
feedback = meets_guidelines(
    guidelines=[""Be polite and respectful."", ""Must be in English.""],
    context={""response"": ""Hello, how are you?""}
)
```

The fix is minimal (4 lines) and maintains full backward compatibility while enabling the documented API to work as expected.

Fixes #16013.

3151211971,5792,Add analyzer and code fix to migrate from StringAssert to Assert APIs,"This PR implements an analyzer and code fix to help migrate from `StringAssert` APIs to equivalent `Assert` APIs with swapped parameter order.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Missing Assert Methods
Created `Assert.StringMethods.cs` with new methods that have swapped parameter order compared to StringAssert:

```csharp
// Before (StringAssert)
StringAssert.Contains(value, substring);
StringAssert.StartsWith(value, substring);
StringAssert.EndsWith(value, substring);
StringAssert.Matches(value, pattern);
StringAssert.DoesNotMatch(value, pattern);

// After (Assert - parameters swapped)
Assert.Contains(substring, value);
Assert.StartsWith(substring, value);
Assert.EndsWith(substring, value);
Assert.Matches(pattern, value);
Assert.DoesNotMatch(pattern, value);
```

All methods include comprehensive overloads supporting:
- String comparison types
- Custom messages and formatting parameters
- Proper parameter validation and error messaging

### 2. Extended UseProperAssertMethodsAnalyzer
- Added detection for StringAssert method calls alongside existing Assert method analysis
- Added `CodeFixModeSwapArguments` for the new transformation pattern
- Maps all StringAssert methods to their equivalent Assert counterparts

### 3. Extended UseProperAssertMethodsFixer
- Added `FixAssertMethodForSwapArgumentsModeAsync` method to handle the transformation
- Changes class name from `StringAssert` to `Assert`
- Swaps the first two arguments while preserving additional parameters
- Handles all StringAssert method overloads correctly

### 4. Added Comprehensive Tests
Added test cases covering:
- All StringAssert methods (Contains, StartsWith, EndsWith, Matches, DoesNotMatch)
- Parameter swapping verification
- Message and additional parameter preservation
- Proper diagnostic reporting

## Example Transformation

```csharp
// Before
StringAssert.Contains(actualString, expectedSubstring, ""Should contain substring"");

// After (with code fix applied)
Assert.Contains(expectedSubstring, actualString, ""Should contain substring"");
```

The analyzer reports this as an info-level diagnostic (MSTEST0037) with the message:
""Use 'Assert.Contains' instead of 'StringAssert.Contains'""

This helps developers migrate to the more consistent Assert API where the expected value comes first, matching the pattern used in other Assert methods like `Assert.AreEqual(expected, actual)`.

Fixes #5791.

3151219647,5793,Improve error message for all Assert.Contains.cs APIs,"The error message for `ContainsSingle` with a predicate was confusing because it used the same generic message as the non-predicate version, suggesting the collection should have size 1 rather than explaining that exactly one item should match the predicate.

**Before:**
```csharp
var collection = new List<int> { 1, 3, 5 };
Assert.ContainsSingle(x => x % 2 == 0, collection);
// Error: ""Assert.ContainsSingle failed. Expected collection of size 1. Actual: 0.""
```

This message is misleading because it suggests the entire collection should have size 1, when actually the assertion is checking that exactly one item matches the predicate `x % 2 == 0`.

**After:**
```csharp
var collection = new List<int> { 1, 3, 5 };
Assert.ContainsSingle(x => x % 2 == 0, collection);
// Error: ""Assert.ContainsSingle failed. Expected exactly one item to match the predicate. Actual: 0.""
```

The new message clearly explains that the assertion is looking for exactly one item that matches the predicate.

**Changes made:**
- Added new resource string `ContainsSingleMatchFailMsg` for predicate-specific error messages
- Added `ThrowAssertSingleMatchFailed` method to handle predicate-specific errors
- Updated predicate version of `ContainsSingle` to use the new error method
- Updated all corresponding tests to expect the new error message format
- Non-predicate version continues to use the original error message format

This improvement makes debugging failed assertions much clearer for developers using predicate-based `ContainsSingle` calls.

3151403816,9903,Fix Outerloop Tests workflow failing on forks,"The ""Outerloop Tests"" workflow was failing on forks because the `results` job condition was inconsistent with the other jobs in the workflow.

## Problem

When the workflow runs on a fork:
1. The `generate_tests_matrix` and `run_tests` jobs are correctly skipped due to the condition `if: ${{ github.repository_owner == 'dotnet' }}`
2. However, the `results` job still runs because it only had `if: always()` without the repository owner check
3. This causes the `results` job to fail when trying to organize test results that don't exist (since the previous jobs were skipped)

## Solution

Updated the `results` job condition from:
```yaml
if: always()
```

to:
```yaml
if: ${{ always() && github.repository_owner == 'dotnet' }}
```

This matches the pattern used in the main `tests.yml` workflow and ensures the `results` job only runs when the repository owner is 'dotnet', preventing failures on forks while still allowing it to run even if previous jobs fail in the main repository.

Fixes #9892.

3081726196,9458,Graceful error handling for offline scenarios in 'aspire new' and 'aspire add' commands,"## Problem

When running the `aspire new` or `aspire add` commands without an internet connection, the CLI attempts to prompt the user to select from a list of available template versions or packages. Since no templates/packages are available offline, this results in an unhandled exception (`System.InvalidOperationException: Cannot show an empty selection prompt`).

## Changes

This PR adds proper error handling for offline scenarios by:

1. Adding an `EmptyChoicesException` class to handle cases with no available choices
2. Modifying the `InteractionService.PromptForSelectionAsync` method to check if the choices collection is empty before attempting to prompt the user
3. Updating command classes to:
   - Check for empty package collections
   - Throw meaningful exceptions with clear error messages
   - Catch and handle these exceptions appropriately

## User Experience

When offline or when no templates/packages are found, the user will now receive clear error messages like:

> No template versions were found. Please check your internet connection or NuGet source configuration.

> No integration packages were found. Please check your internet connection or NuGet source configuration.

## Testing

Added tests for:
- Empty collection handling in `InteractionService`
- Error handling for empty template/package lists in `NewCommand` and `AddCommand`

Fixes #9457.

3174512200,10037,Refactor publishing state model and CLI protocol to aggregate CompletionState at all levels,"## Overview

This PR refactors the publishing workflow to use a unified state model with hierarchical relationships and automatic state aggregation, replacing the previous boolean-based approach with a cleaner, more maintainable design.

## Key Changes

### 1. Unified State Model
- **Renamed** `TaskCompletionState` → `CompletionState` 
- **Added** `CompletionState` property to `PublishingStep` and top-level activities
- **Replaced** multiple boolean properties (`IsComplete`, `IsError`) with single enum
- **Maintained** backward compatibility by keeping boolean fields in protocol

### 2. Hierarchical Relationships
- **Added** `Tasks` collection to `PublishingStep` as `IReadOnlyDictionary<string, PublishingTask>`
- **Added** `ParentStep` reference property to `PublishingTask`
- **Implemented** automatic parent-child relationship management

### 3. IAsyncDisposable Pattern
- **Implemented** `IAsyncDisposable` on both `PublishingStep` and `PublishingTask`
- **Added** automatic completion and state aggregation on disposal
- **Enabled** modern `await using` pattern for resource management

### 4. State Aggregation Logic
- **Implemented** automatic state propagation from children to parents
- **Added** `CalculateAggregatedState()` method using maximum severity logic
- **Ensured** parent completion always reflects current child states

### 5. Protocol Updates
- **Added** `CompletionState` field to backchannel `PublishingActivityData`
- **Updated** CLI consumer code to use new state-based logic
- **Maintained** existing boolean fields for backward compatibility

## Usage Example

The new API prevents the ""running forever"" state issue by ensuring automatic completion:

```csharp
await using var step = await activityReporter.CreateStepAsync(""Publish Artifacts"", ct);

await using var pkgTask = await step.CreateTaskAsync(""Zipping assets"", ct);
try
{
    // Work happens here...
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    await pkgTask.FailAsync(ex.Message, ct);
    throw;
}

await using var deployTask = await step.CreateTaskAsync(""Pushing assets"", ct);
// Tasks and step automatically complete on disposal with proper state aggregation
```

## Benefits

- **Error-proof API**: Disposal ensures operations never remain stuck in ""running forever"" state
- **Cleaner code**: Single enum replaces multiple boolean properties
- **Automatic aggregation**: Parent states reflect child completion status
- **Modern patterns**: Full support for `await using` resource management
- **Backward compatibility**: Existing protocol consumers continue to work

## Files Changed

- `src/Aspire.Hosting/Publishing/PublishingActivityProgressReporter.cs` - Core state model implementation
- `src/Aspire.Hosting/Publishing/PublishingExtensions.cs` - Updated helper methods
- `src/Aspire.Hosting/Publishing/Publisher.cs` - Updated to use new enum
- `src/Aspire.Hosting/Publishing/ResourceContainerImageBuilder.cs` - Updated completion calls
- `src/Aspire.Hosting.Azure/AzurePublishingContext.cs` - Migrated to new model
- `src/Aspire.Cli/Commands/PublishCommandBase.cs` - Updated CLI consumer logic
- `src/Aspire.*/Backchannel/BackchannelDataTypes.cs` - Protocol updates
- Test files updated for new API

Fixes #10036.

## Problem

The autoformat workflow currently does not verify whether the ""Allow edits and access to secrets by maintainers"" checkbox is checked on pull requests. This checkbox is important for security and workflow functionality, as it allows maintainers to make edits and access secrets needed for the autoformat process.

## Solution

This PR adds a validation step that checks the `maintainer_can_modify` property of pull requests before running the autoformat process. If the checkbox is not checked, the workflow will:

1. Post a helpful comment on the PR explaining what needs to be done
2. Fail early with a clear error message  
3. Include a link to the workflow run for debugging

## Changes Made

### `.github/workflows/autoformat.js`
- Added `checkMaintainerAccess` function that:
  - Fetches PR data using the GitHub API
  - Checks if `maintainer_can_modify` is true
  - Posts a helpful comment with clear instructions if the checkbox is not checked
  - Throws an error to fail the workflow early
  - Includes workflow run URL in the comment for debugging

### `.github/workflows/autoformat.yml`
- Added validation step in the `check-comment` job that:
  - Runs only when `shouldAutoformat` is true (conditional execution)
  - Uses existing `pull-requests: write` permission
  - Calls the new `checkMaintainerAccess` function

## Testing

Created and ran tests to verify:
- ✅ Function completes successfully when maintainer access is allowed
- ✅ Function posts helpful comment when maintainer access is denied
- ✅ Function throws appropriate error when maintainer access is denied
- ✅ All exports are correctly configured
- ✅ YAML and JavaScript syntax validation passed

## Example Comment

When the checkbox is not checked, users will see:

```
❌ **Autoformat failed**: The ""Allow edits and access to secrets by maintainers"" checkbox must be checked for autoformat to work properly.

Please:
1. Check the ""Allow edits and access to secrets by maintainers"" checkbox on this pull request
2. Comment `/autoformat` again

This permission is required for the autoformat bot to push changes to your branch.

**Details:** [View workflow run](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/actions/runs/123456789)
```

This improvement enhances security by ensuring proper permissions are granted before running autoformat operations and provides clear feedback to users about what needs to be done.

Fixes #16384.

The `test_save_model_with_partner_package` function in `tests/langchain/test_langchain_model_export.py` was using `pytest.warns()` incorrectly. The test was issuing dummy warnings to prevent the context manager from failing when no warnings were naturally issued, which made the test meaningless and confusing.

## Problem

The original implementation had several issues:

1. **Incorrect `pytest.warns()` usage**: Used `pytest.warns()` without specifying what warning to expect
2. **Dummy warning workaround**: Manually issued `warnings.warn(""dummy"")` to satisfy the context manager
3. **Misleading test logic**: The helper function `_is_partner_pkg_warning_issued()` always issued a dummy warning, making it impossible to distinguish between real warnings and artificial ones

```python
# Before (incorrect)
with pytest.warns() as ws:
    mlflow.langchain.save_model(chain, tmp_path / ""community-model"")
    assert not _is_partner_pkg_warning_issued(ws)  # Always issues dummy warning

def _is_partner_pkg_warning_issued(ws):
    warnings.warn(""dummy"")  # This defeats the purpose of the test
    return any(str(w.message).startswith(""Your model contains..."") for w in ws)
```

## Solution

Replaced the incorrect usage with proper warning handling patterns:

1. **For cases expecting NO warnings**: Use `warnings.catch_warnings()` with `warnings.filterwarnings(""error"")` to convert specific warnings to exceptions
2. **For cases expecting warnings**: Use `pytest.warns()` with specific warning matching
3. **Remove dummy warning mechanism**: Eliminate the helper function entirely

```python
# After (correct)
# Case 1: No warning expected
with warnings.catch_warnings():
    warnings.filterwarnings(""error"", message="".*LangChain partner package.*"")
    mlflow.langchain.save_model(chain, tmp_path / ""community-model"")

# Case 2: Warning expected  
with pytest.warns(match=r"".*LangChain partner package.*""):
    mlflow.langchain.save_model(chain, tmp_path / ""partner-model"")
```

This approach follows the same pattern used in `tests/evaluate/test_deprecated.py` and properly validates the expected behavior:
- Test cases expecting no warnings will fail if warnings are issued
- Test cases expecting warnings will fail if no warnings are issued
- No dummy warnings are needed

Fixes #16388.

This PR enables two pytest warning-related Ruff rules to improve test quality and consistency:

- `PT030` (pytest-warns-too-broad): Catches overly broad `pytest.warns()` usage without specific `match` parameters
- `PT031` (pytest-warns-with-multiple-statements): Catches `pytest.warns()` context managers with multiple statements that could cause false negatives

## Changes Made

1. **Added PT030 and PT031 to enabled rules** in `pyproject.toml`
2. **Configured `warns-require-match-for = [""*""]`** to require `match` parameters for all warning types, similar to the existing `raises-require-match-for` configuration

## Benefits

These rules will help maintain test precision by:
- Ensuring warning tests target specific expected warnings rather than catching any warning of a given type
- Preventing false negatives where unrelated warnings are caught instead of the intended warnings  
- Making warning-related tests more explicit and maintainable
- Following pytest testing best practices for warning assertions

## Validation

- ✅ All existing `pytest.warns()` calls already follow best practices with appropriate `match` parameters
- ✅ No violations were found in the current codebase - the rules serve as preventive measures
- ✅ Created validation tests to confirm the rules correctly identify violations while allowing valid usage
- ✅ All linting and existing functionality remains unchanged

The MLflow codebase already demonstrates excellent pytest warning test practices, and these rules will help maintain that standard going forward.

Fixes #16391.

3126016118,9748,Add generic WithEnvironment overload for IValueProvider and IManifestExpressionProvider,"This PR adds a catch-all generic overload for `WithEnvironment` that accepts any type implementing both `IValueProvider` and `IManifestExpressionProvider`, eliminating the need for specific overloads for each such type.

## Changes

Added the requested generic overload with the exact signature from the issue:

```csharp
public static IResourceBuilder<T> WithEnvironment<T, TValue>(this IResourceBuilder<T> builder, string name, TValue value)
    where T : IResourceWithEnvironment
    where TValue : IValueProvider, IManifestExpressionProvider
```

## Implementation Details

- **Proper argument validation** with `ArgumentNullException.ThrowIfNull`
- **Resource reference linking** via `WalkAndLinkResourceReferences` for types implementing `IValueWithReferences`
- **Integration with existing environment variable evaluation system**
- **Support for both runtime and manifest scenarios** through the dual interface constraints

## Example Usage

This overload works with existing types like `EndpointReference`, `ParameterResource`, `ConnectionStringReference`, and any custom types implementing both interfaces:

```csharp
// Works with existing types
var endpoint = container.GetEndpoint(""http"");
builder.WithEnvironment(""ENDPOINT_URL"", endpoint);

// Works with custom types
public class CustomValue : IValueProvider, IManifestExpressionProvider
{
    public ValueTask<string?> GetValueAsync(CancellationToken ct) => ValueTask.FromResult(""runtime-value"");
    public string ValueExpression => ""manifest-expression"";
}

builder.WithEnvironment(""CUSTOM_VAR"", new CustomValue());
```

## Testing

Added comprehensive tests covering:
- Types implementing both required interfaces
- Resource reference handling for `IValueWithReferences` types
- Argument validation
- Both runtime (`IValueProvider`) and manifest (`IManifestExpressionProvider`) scenarios

Fixes #9747.

3179795816,10074,Add ContainerBuildOptions support to ResourceContainerImageBuilder for customizing dotnet publish,"This PR adds support for passing additional arguments to `dotnet publish` commands when building container images through the `ResourceContainerImageBuilder`. 

## Problem

The `ResourceContainerImageBuilder` currently invokes `dotnet publish` with hardcoded arguments and doesn't support setting additional MSBuild properties that callers might need, such as:
- `/p:ContainerImageFormat`
- `/p:ContainerArchiveOutputPath` 
- `/p:ContainerRuntimeIdentifier`

## Solution

Added a strongly-typed API through new types:

### New API Surface
```csharp
[Experimental(""ASPIREPUBLISHERS001"")]
public enum ContainerImageFormat
{
    Docker,      // default
    Oci,
}

[Experimental(""ASPIREPUBLISHERS001"")] 
public class ContainerBuildOptions
{
    public string? OutputPath { get; init; }           // → /p:ContainerArchiveOutputPath
    public ContainerImageFormat? ImageFormat { get; init; }  // → /p:ContainerImageFormat  
    public ContainerTargetPlatform? TargetPlatform { get; init; }       // → /p:ContainerRuntimeIdentifier
}
```

Updated `IResourceContainerImageBuilder` interface:
```csharp
Task BuildImageAsync(IResource resource, ContainerBuildOptions? options = null, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);
Task BuildImagesAsync(IEnumerable<IResource> resources, ContainerBuildOptions? options = null, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);
```

### Usage Example
```csharp
var options = new ContainerBuildOptions
{
    ImageFormat = ContainerImageFormat.OciTar,
    OutputPath = ""/tmp/output"",
    TargetPlatform = ""linux-x64""  
};

await imageBuilder.BuildImageAsync(resource, options, cancellationToken);
```

This generates the command:
```bash
dotnet publish [project] --configuration Release /t:PublishContainer /p:ContainerRepository=[name] /p:ContainerImageFormat=OciTar /p:ContainerArchiveOutputPath=/tmp/output /p:ContainerRuntimeIdentifier=linux-x64
```

## Implementation Details

- **Backward Compatible**: All existing code continues to work unchanged through default parameter values
- **Strongly Typed**: Uses enums and proper types instead of raw string arguments
- **MSBuild Integration**: Maps options directly to the correct MSBuild properties
- **Minimal Changes**: Only adds new functionality without modifying existing behavior
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Includes unit tests for new functionality

## Testing

- Updated all existing tests to use the new signature
- Added new tests validating `ContainerBuildOptions` functionality
- Updated mock implementations in test projects
- Verified all builds complete successfully
- Created validation test program demonstrating the new API

Fixes #10000.

3078330455,9433,Add test coverage for --aspire-version template option,"This PR adds test coverage for the `--aspire-version` template option to ensure it works correctly across different framework targets. 

## Changes

Added tests in `NewUpAndBuildSupportProjectTemplatesTests.cs` for:
- `--aspire-version 9.2`
- `--aspire-version 9.3` 

These test cases will run across all SDK and target framework combinations through the existing test infrastructure, ensuring comprehensive coverage of this option.

## Motivation

With .NET 9.1 adding support for selecting between versions 8.2, 9.0, and 9.1 (depending on the target framework), we needed test coverage for this potentially fragile area of the codebase.

The added test cases validate that the template parameter works correctly in all supported environments.

Fixes #7279.

</details>

## Summary

Removes the duplicate `yarn eslint` step from `.circleci/config.yml` to eliminate redundancy with the identical linting step in `.github/workflows/docs.yml`.

## Changes Made

- Removed the ""Lint"" step (lines 88-91) from the `build_doc` job in `.circleci/config.yml`
- The CircleCI workflow now flows directly from ""Install JS dependencies"" to ""Build documentation""

## Before/After

**Before**: Both CI systems were running identical linting:
- CircleCI: `yarn eslint` in docs directory
- GitHub Actions: `yarn eslint` in docs directory

**After**: Only GitHub Actions runs the linting step, eliminating duplication while maintaining the same coverage.

## Impact

- ✅ Reduces CI execution time and resource usage
- ✅ Eliminates duplicate linting checks  
- ✅ Maintains identical linting coverage through GitHub Actions workflow
- ✅ No impact on documentation building functionality
- ✅ No impact on documentation preview generation

The GitHub Actions workflow continues to provide the same ESLint coverage for `.md` and `.mdx` files in the docs directory, ensuring no reduction in code quality checks.

Fixes #16530.

3195598738,16533,Skip maintainer access check for copilot bot in autoformat workflow,"The `checkMaintainerAccess` function in `.github/workflows/autoformat.js` was failing for PRs created by the `copilot` bot because it always checks the ""Allow edits and access to secrets by maintainers"" checkbox, regardless of the PR author.

## Problem
When the copilot bot creates PRs, the autoformat workflow would fail with:
```
❌ Autoformat failed: The ""Allow edits and access to secrets by maintainers"" checkbox must be checked for autoformat to work properly.
```

This check is unnecessary for copilot bot PRs since:
- The copilot bot creates PRs that are owned by the repository
- The maintainer access check is meant for external contributors
- Bot-created PRs don't need the same permission model as user-created PRs

## Solution
Modified the `checkMaintainerAccess` function to detect when the PR author is the `copilot` bot and skip the maintainer access check in that case:

```javascript
// Skip maintainer access check for copilot bot PRs
// Copilot bot creates PRs that are owned by the repository and don't need the same permission model
if (pr.data.user && 
    pr.data.user.type && 
    pr.data.user.type.toLowerCase() === 'bot' && 
    pr.data.user.login && 
    pr.data.user.login.toLowerCase() === 'copilot') {
  console.log(`Skipping maintainer access check for copilot bot PR #${pull_number}`);
  return;
}
```

## Key Features
- ✅ **Surgical change**: Only 13 lines added, no existing code modified
- ✅ **Specific to copilot**: Only the `copilot` bot gets special treatment
- ✅ **Case-insensitive detection**: Handles variations in casing
- ✅ **Preserves existing behavior**: All other users and bots follow the normal flow
- ✅ **Proper logging**: Clear console output when the check is skipped
- ✅ **Follows existing patterns**: Similar to bot detection in `validate-author/index.js`

## Testing
Comprehensive testing verified:
- Copilot bot PRs skip the check (regardless of `maintainer_can_modify` value)
- Regular users still go through normal validation
- Other bots (like dependabot) still require the maintainer checkbox
- Edge cases with missing/null data are handled properly
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

Fixes #16532.

## Summary

This PR removes the unused Windows job from the CircleCI configuration file (`.circleci/config.yml`). The job was serving only as a placeholder to get a free Windows VM for testing purposes and wasn't performing any actual CI tasks.

## Changes Made

- **Removed Windows orb import**: `win: circleci/windows@5.0.0` 
- **Removed Windows job definition**: The entire `windows` job that only performed checkout
- **Removed workflow reference**: Removed `windows` from the `build` workflow jobs list

## Impact

- ✅ **Cleaner CI configuration** - Removes confusing placeholder job
- ✅ **Reduced resource usage** - No longer schedules unused Windows VM
- ✅ **Maintained functionality** - All existing jobs (`build_doc`, `build_doc_r`) preserved
- ✅ **Valid YAML** - Configuration remains syntactically correct

## Before/After

**Before**: 3 jobs in workflow (`build_doc`, `build_doc_r`, `windows`)
**After**: 2 jobs in workflow (`build_doc`, `build_doc_r`)

The Windows VM for development/debugging purposes can be accessed through other means if needed, rather than being part of the main CI pipeline.

**Total lines removed**: 12 lines (minimal, surgical change)

Fixes #16534.

3195801570,10203,Add CTRL-C guidance message to aspire run command output,"## Summary

This PR adds a user guidance message to the `aspire run` command output that instructs users how to stop the AppHost. The message ""Press **Ctrl+C** to stop the app host and exit."" is displayed in the console grid after the dashboard links and before the logs information.

## Changes

- Modified `src/Aspire.Cli/Commands/RunCommand.cs` to add two new rows to the Spectre.Console grid:
  1. A blank row for spacing
  2. The CTRL-C guidance message in the rightmost column
- Reused the existing localized resource string `RunCommandStrings.PressCtrlCToStopAppHost` which contains the properly formatted message with Spectre.Console markup

## Output Format

The new output will display:

```
Dashboard:  [dashboard-url]
            [codespaces-url] (if applicable)

            Press Ctrl+C to stop the app host and exit.
Logs:       [log-file-path]
```

## Implementation Details

- The changes are minimal and surgical - only 2 lines added
- No existing functionality is modified or removed
- Uses existing localization infrastructure
- Consistent with Spectre.Console formatting patterns used elsewhere in the codebase
- All existing CLI tests continue to pass (99/99)

The positioning ensures the guidance message appears after all dashboard links but before the logs information, providing clear user instruction on how to terminate the running AppHost.

3195859598,10207,Refine aspire CLI run command grid display with right-aligned labels and padding,"This PR refines the visual display of the aspire CLI `run` command grid that shows dashboard and logs information by implementing the following improvements:

## Changes Made

1. **Added padding column**: Inserted an empty column as the first column of the grid for better visual spacing
2. **Right-aligned field labels**: Used Spectre.Console's `Align` renderable with `HorizontalAlignment.Right` to right-align the field labels (""Dashboard:"" and ""Logs:"")
3. **Updated grid structure**: Modified all `grid.AddRow()` calls to accommodate the new 3-column structure: [Padding] [Right-aligned Label] [Value]

## Before
```
Dashboard: https://localhost:5001
           https://codespaces-url  
Logs:      /path/to/logfile.txt
```

## After  
```
     Dashboard: https://localhost:5001
                https://codespaces-url
          Logs: /path/to/logfile.txt
```

The changes provide better visual alignment and spacing, making the output more readable and professionally formatted.

## Technical Details

- Used `new Align(new Markup(""[bold green]Dashboard[/]:""), HorizontalAlignment.Right)` for right-aligned labels
- Added `grid.AddColumn(); // Padding column` as the first column
- Updated all `grid.AddRow()` calls to include `new Text(string.Empty)` as the first parameter for the padding column
- Maintained backward compatibility - no breaking changes to functionality

The implementation follows the existing Spectre.Console patterns used throughout the codebase and makes minimal, surgical changes to achieve the desired visual improvements.

3106326653,15996,Fix `deny_unpinned_actions` policy to work for composite actions,"The `deny_unpinned_actions` rule in `.github/policy.rego` was only checking for unpinned actions in workflow files (which have a `jobs` field) but not in composite action files (which have a `runs` field instead).

## Problem

Composite actions in `.github/actions/` use a different structure than workflow files:

**Workflow files** have:
```yaml
jobs:
  job-name:
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4  # ❌ Would be caught by policy
```

**Composite actions** have:
```yaml
runs:
  using: ""composite""
  steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4  # ❌ Was NOT caught by policy
```

## Solution

Modified the policy to handle both structures:

1. **Updated `deny_unpinned_actions` rule** to use a new helper function that checks both workflows and composite actions
2. **Added `get_unpinned_actions_from_jobs_or_runs` helper** with two rule definitions:
   - One for workflow files with `jobs` field (delegates to existing logic)
   - One for composite action files with `runs.steps` field (checks steps directly)

## Testing

- ✅ Unpinned actions in composite actions are now correctly detected as failures
- ✅ Properly pinned actions in composite actions pass validation  
- ✅ Local action references (e.g., `./github/actions/setup-python`) continue to pass
- ✅ All existing workflow tests continue to pass (198/198)
- ✅ All composite action files in repo pass validation (30/30 tests)

## Example

Before this fix:
```bash
$ conftest test --policy .github/policy.rego composite-with-unpinned.yml
6 tests, 6 passed, 0 warnings, 0 failures, 0 exceptions  # ❌ Should have failed
```

After this fix:
```bash
$ conftest test --policy .github/policy.rego composite-with-unpinned.yml
FAIL - composite-with-unpinned.yml - main - The following actions are not pinned by full commit SHA: actions/checkout@v4  # ✅ Correctly fails
```

Fixes #15995.

3152485982,5795,Add TestCategories property to ITestDataRow for per-test-case categorization,"This PR adds support for applying test categories to individual test data rows in parameterized tests, addressing a long-standing user request for more granular test categorization.

## Changes

### Core API Changes
- Added `TestCategories` property to `ITestDataRow` interface
- Implemented `TestCategories` property in `TestDataRow<T>` class with `[DataMember]` attribute
- Property is nullable to maintain backward compatibility

### Discovery Logic Updates
- Updated `TestDataSourceHelpers.TryHandleITestDataRow()` to extract test categories from test data rows
- Added backward-compatible overload to maintain existing API
- Modified discovery logic in `AssemblyEnumerator` to merge test categories from test data rows with existing method/class/assembly level categories

### Usage Example

```csharp
[TestMethod]
[DynamicData(nameof(GetTestData), DynamicDataSourceType.Method)]
public void MyParameterizedTest(string input, string expected)
{
    Assert.AreEqual(expected, ProcessInput(input));
}

public static IEnumerable<object[]> GetTestData()
{
    // Fast unit test case
    yield return new TestDataRow<(string, string)>((""input1"", ""output1""))
    {
        TestCategories = new List<string> { ""Unit"", ""Fast"" },
        DisplayName = ""Fast unit test""
    };
    
    // Slow integration test case
    yield return new TestDataRow<(string, string)>((""input2"", ""output2""))
    {
        TestCategories = new List<string> { ""Integration"", ""Slow"" },
        DisplayName = ""Integration test""
    };
}
```

### Benefits
- **Granular filtering**: Can now filter tests by categories applied to individual test cases
- **Mixed scenarios**: Single test method can contain both unit tests and integration tests with appropriate categories
- **Category inheritance**: Test data row categories are merged with method/class/assembly level categories
- **Backward compatibility**: Existing code continues to work unchanged

### Test Coverage
- Added comprehensive unit tests for `TestDataRow` and `TestDataSourceHelpers`
- Added integration tests to verify end-to-end functionality
- Created sample test project demonstrating real-world usage
- Validated category filtering works correctly with test discovery

This enables scenarios like:
```bash
# Run only fast test cases
dotnet test --filter ""TestCategory=Fast""

# Run only integration test cases  
dotnet test --filter ""TestCategory=Integration""
```

3152602811,5797,Add CIConditionAttribute to support CI-specific test execution control,"This PR implements `CIConditionAttribute` to allow developers to conditionally run or skip tests based on whether they are executing in a Continuous Integration (CI) environment.

## Summary

The new attribute addresses a common need in test suites where certain tests should behave differently in CI environments - either running only in CI or being temporarily disabled in CI (e.g., for flaky tests).

## Usage

```csharp
[TestMethod]
[CICondition(ConditionMode.Include)]  // Run only in CI
public void PerformanceTestOnlyInCI()
{
    // Resource-intensive test that should only run in CI infrastructure
}

[TestMethod]
[CICondition(ConditionMode.Exclude)]  // Skip in CI
public void FlakyTestTemporarilyDisabledInCI()
{
    // Temporarily disable flaky test in CI while keeping it for local development
}
```

## Implementation Details

- **Follows existing patterns**: Inherits from `ConditionBaseAttribute` like `OSConditionAttribute`
- **Comprehensive CI detection**: Supports major CI systems including:
  - GitHub Actions (`GITHUB_ACTIONS`)
  - Azure Pipelines (`TF_BUILD`)
  - AppVeyor (`APPVEYOR`)
  - Travis CI (`TRAVIS`)
  - CircleCI (`CIRCLECI`)
  - Jenkins (`BUILD_ID` + `BUILD_URL`)
  - TeamCity (`TEAMCITY_VERSION`)
  - AWS CodeBuild (`CODEBUILD_BUILD_ID` + `AWS_REGION`)
  - Google Cloud Build (`BUILD_ID` + `PROJECT_ID`)
  - JetBrains Space (`JB_SPACE_API_URL`)
  - Generic CI (`CI`)

- **CI detection logic**: Based on the well-documented detection from .NET SDK telemetry (https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/tools/telemetry#continuous-integration-detection)
- **Comprehensive testing**: 20+ unit tests covering all CI detection scenarios and edge cases
- **API consistency**: Updated PublicAPI files for proper API tracking

## Use Cases

1. **Flaky test management**: Temporarily disable problematic tests in CI while keeping them active for local development
2. **Resource-intensive tests**: Run performance or integration tests only in CI environments with adequate resources
3. **CI-specific scenarios**: Handle tests that depend on CI infrastructure or specific CI configurations

The attribute can be applied to both test methods and test classes, supporting standard MSTest condition attribute grouping behavior.

Fixes #5533.

Assert.IsFalse(a > b);

// After (suggested by analyzer)
Assert.IsGreaterThan(b, a);
Assert.IsGreaterThanOrEqualTo(b, a);
Assert.IsLessThan(b, a);
Assert.IsLessThanOrEqualTo(b, a);
Assert.IsLessThanOrEqualTo(b, a);
```

### Collection Count/Length Checks
```csharp
// Before
Assert.AreEqual(0, myCollection.Count);
Assert.AreEqual(3, myCollection.Count);
Assert.AreEqual(myCollection.Count, 0);
Assert.AreEqual(myArray.Length, 5);

// After (suggested by analyzer)
Assert.IsEmpty(myCollection);
Assert.HasCount(3, myCollection);
Assert.IsEmpty(myCollection);
Assert.HasCount(5, myArray);
```

## Implementation Details

- **Pattern Recognition**: Added specialized recognition methods for string methods, collection operations, numeric comparisons, and count checks with proper type validation
- **Code Fixing**: Enhanced the code fixer with a new `CodeFixModeCollectionCount` mode to handle complex argument transformations for collection count assertions
- **Argument Handling**: Implemented proper argument reordering for comparison methods (e.g., `a > b` becomes `IsGreaterThan(b, a)` where `b` is the lower bound)
- **Type Safety**: Added collection type checking to ensure suggestions are only made for appropriate types (excludes strings from collection checks, validates IEnumerable implementations)
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: All new patterns work with both `Assert.IsTrue` and `Assert.IsFalse` where applicable, with appropriate logic inversion

## Testing

Added comprehensive test cases covering all new scenarios:
- String method transformations with various string operations
- Collection method transformations with different collection types  
- All comparison operations including negated cases
- Collection count checks with both `Count` and `Length` properties
- Edge cases and type validation scenarios

All existing functionality is preserved and continues to work as before. The new patterns integrate seamlessly with the existing analyzer infrastructure.

Fixes #6057.

3235168159,10453,Remove deprecated parameterless GetDashboardUrlsAsync method from AppHostRpcTarget,"## Description

This PR removes the deprecated parameterless `GetDashboardUrlsAsync()` method from the `AppHostRpcTarget` class as requested in the issue. This method was an old API that is no longer used and should be cleaned up.

## Changes Made

- Removed the `GetDashboardUrlsAsync()` method without parameters from `src/Aspire.Hosting/Backchannel/AppHostRpcTarget.cs` (lines 120-123)
- The method with `CancellationToken` parameter remains unchanged and continues to be used by all existing code

## Impact

- **No breaking changes**: All existing usage already calls the overload with `CancellationToken` parameter
- **No interface changes**: The `IAppHostBackchannel` interface only defines the version with `CancellationToken`
- **Clean removal**: No other code references the parameterless version

## Verification

- ✅ Build completes successfully
- ✅ CLI tests pass (69 tests executed, all passed)  
- ✅ No remaining references to the parameterless method found in codebase
- ✅ Code follows repository formatting standards

The removed method was just a convenience wrapper that called `GetDashboardUrlsAsync(CancellationToken.None)`, so its removal simplifies the API without affecting functionality.

*This pull request was created as a result of the following prompt from Copilot chat.*
> The method GetDashboardUrlsAsync() without a CancellationToken parameter in AppHostRpcTarget is an old API which is no longer used and should be removed. Remove this method from the following:
> - AppHostRpcTarget class in src/Aspire.Hosting/Backchannel/AppHostRpcTarget.cs
> - Any related usage or reference in the AppHost backchannel code.
> 
> Do not remove the overload that accepts a CancellationToken.
> Ensure the code builds and is consistent with formatting and style guidelines (.editorconfig).
> Do not update global.json or any files under */api/*.cs.

3235179464,6060,Replace LINQ Any+Single patterns with Where+FirstOrDefault for better performance,"This PR addresses a performance optimization opportunity identified in PR #5717 where the pattern of using `Any()` followed by `Single()` with the same predicate can be improved.

## Problem
The existing code uses this pattern in multiple places:
```csharp
if (collection.Any(x => x.Uid == item.Uid))
{
    var existing = collection.Single(x => x.Uid == item.Uid);
    // handle duplicate...
}
```

This approach has two issues:
1. **Performance**: It enumerates the collection twice with the same predicate
2. **Debuggability**: When `Single()` throws, it's harder to debug since you can't inspect the actual duplicate items

## Solution
Replace the pattern with:
```csharp
var existing = collection.Where(x => x.Uid == item.Uid).FirstOrDefault();
if (existing is not null)
{
    // handle duplicate...
}
```

## Benefits
- **Performance**: Single enumeration instead of two separate LINQ operations
- **Debuggability**: Better error context - developers can inspect the actual duplicate object when debugging
- **Maintainability**: More explicit null checking following modern C# best practices

## Changes
Updated 14 instances across 3 files:
- `TestHostOrchestratorManager.cs` (2 instances)
- `TestHostControllersManager.cs` (6 instances) 
- `TestHostManager.cs` (6 instances)

All changes maintain identical functional behavior while improving performance and debugging experience.

Fixes #5739.

3189842687,10152,Add NameOutputReference and AddAsExistingResource to AzureAppServiceEnvironmentResource,"This PR implements the missing `NameOutputReference` property and `AddAsExistingResource` method on `AzureAppServiceEnvironmentResource` to match the functionality provided by `AzureContainerAppEnvironmentResource`.

## Changes Made

### AzureAppServiceEnvironmentResource.cs
- Added required imports for `Azure.Provisioning.AppService` and `Azure.Provisioning.Primitives`
- Implemented `NameOutputReference` property that returns a `BicepOutputReference` with name ""name""
- Implemented `AddAsExistingResource` method that uses `AppServicePlan.FromExisting()` and configures it with the name parameter

### AzureAppServiceEnvironmentExtensions.cs  
- Added infrastructure output for the App Service Plan name using `plan.Name` value

### Tests
- Added `AzureAppServiceEnvironmentHasNameOutputReference` test to verify the property exists and works correctly
- Added `AzureAppServiceEnvironmentCanReferenceExistingAppServicePlan` test to validate the existing resource functionality

## Implementation Pattern

The implementation follows the same pattern as other Azure resources in the codebase:

```csharp
// NameOutputReference property
public BicepOutputReference NameOutputReference => new(""name"", this);

// AddAsExistingResource method  
public override ProvisionableResource AddAsExistingResource(AzureResourceInfrastructure infra)
{
    var plan = AppServicePlan.FromExisting(this.GetBicepIdentifier());
    plan.Name = NameOutputReference.AsProvisioningParameter(infra);
    infra.Add(plan);
    return plan;
}
```

This matches the pattern used by:
- `AzureContainerAppEnvironmentResource` (uses `ContainerAppManagedEnvironment.FromExisting()`)
- `AzureContainerRegistryResource` (uses `ContainerRegistryService.FromExisting()`)
- `AzureAppConfigurationResource` (uses `AppConfigurationStore.FromExisting()`)

With these changes, users can now reference existing App Service Plans in their Aspire applications using the same API as other Azure resources.

Fixes #10151.

3222379511,10320,Improve parameter resolution logging and exception handling in ParameterProcessor,"This PR improves the logging behavior for parameter processing in the Aspire hosting orchestrator by implementing two key changes:

## Changes Made

### 1. Remove exception logging for missing parameter values
- Modified `ProcessParameterAsync` to log warnings without exception details when a `MissingParameterValueException` occurs
- Changed from `LogWarning(ex, message)` to `LogWarning(message)` to reduce noise in logs
- Other exception types continue to log with full exception details as before

### 2. Add parameter resolution logging via interaction service
- Added information logging when parameters are successfully resolved through user interaction
- Uses the resource logger service to log resolution events for better observability
- Helps track when parameters are provided by users during runtime

## Code Changes

**Before:**
```csharp
loggerService.GetLogger(parameterResource)
    .LogWarning(ex, ""Parameter resource {ResourceName} could not be initialized. Waiting for user input."", parameterResource.Name);
```

**After:**
```csharp
loggerService.GetLogger(parameterResource)
    .LogWarning(""Parameter resource {ResourceName} could not be initialized. Waiting for user input."", parameterResource.Name);

// Later, when resolved via interaction:
loggerService.GetLogger(parameter)
    .LogInformation(""Parameter resource {ResourceName} has been resolved via user interaction."", parameter.Name);
```

## Testing

Added comprehensive unit tests to validate:
- Missing parameter values log warnings without exception details
- Non-missing parameter exceptions continue to log with full exception information  
- Parameter resolution via user interaction logs appropriate information messages
- All existing functionality remains unchanged (13/13 tests passing)

These changes improve the clarity and utility of resource parameter logs in Aspire by reducing noise from expected missing parameter scenarios while maintaining full visibility into resolution events.

Fixes #10319.

3112095151,9655,Fix thread safety issue in FindAppHostProjectFilesAsync by switching to ConcurrentBag,"## Problem

The `FindAppHostProjectFilesAsync` method in `ProjectLocator` had a thread safety issue where multiple threads were concurrently adding items to a `List<FileInfo>` within a `Parallel.ForEachAsync` loop. This could lead to race conditions and potential data corruption or exceptions during parallel execution.

```csharp
// Before: Not thread-safe
var appHostProjects = new List<FileInfo>();
await Parallel.ForEachAsync(projectFiles, async (projectFile, ct) =>
{
    // ... async processing ...
    appHostProjects.Add(projectFile); // Multiple threads accessing List concurrently
});
```

## Solution

Replaced the `List<FileInfo>` with `ConcurrentBag<FileInfo>`, which is designed for thread-safe concurrent additions. The sorting logic was updated to convert the `ConcurrentBag` to a `List` before sorting to maintain deterministic ordering.

```csharp
// After: Thread-safe
var appHostProjects = new ConcurrentBag<FileInfo>();
await Parallel.ForEachAsync(projectFiles, async (projectFile, ct) =>
{
    // ... async processing ...
    appHostProjects.Add(projectFile); // Thread-safe concurrent additions
});

// Convert to List for deterministic sorting
var sortedProjects = appHostProjects.ToList();
sortedProjects.Sort((x, y) => x.FullName.CompareTo(y.FullName));
return sortedProjects;
```

## Changes Made

1. **Added using directive**: `using System.Collections.Concurrent;`
2. **Changed collection type**: `List<FileInfo>` → `ConcurrentBag<FileInfo>`
3. **Updated sorting logic**: Convert `ConcurrentBag` to `List` before sorting
4. **Enhanced test coverage**: Added debugging assertions and output to `UseOrFindAppHostProjectFilePromptsWhenMultipleFilesFound` test for better validation

## Testing

- All existing functionality is preserved with the same public API
- Build verification passed for both `Aspire.Cli` and `Aspire.Cli.Tests` projects
- Enhanced test includes additional assertions to verify file creation and alphabetical ordering

This fix ensures thread safety during parallel project file processing while maintaining the same deterministic behavior and performance characteristics.

3112723101,9657,Rename WithBrowserPort to WithHostPort for consistency with other hosting packages,"This PR renames the `WithBrowserPort` method to `WithHostPort` in the Docker Compose Aspire Dashboard extensions to maintain consistency with other hosting packages in the Aspire framework.

## Changes Made

- **Method Rename**: Changed `WithBrowserPort` to `WithHostPort` in `DockerComposeAspireDashboardResourceBuilderExtensions.cs`
- **Documentation Update**: Updated XML documentation to follow the consistent pattern used by other hosting extensions:
  - Summary: ""Configures the host port that the Aspire Dashboard resource is exposed on instead of using randomly assigned port""
  - Parameter: ""The port to bind on the host. If `null` a random port will be assigned""
  - Return type: Fixed to reference the correct type `IResourceBuilder{DockerComposeAspireDashboardResource}`
- **Test Update**: Updated test usage in `DockerComposePublisherTests.cs` from `.WithBrowserPort(8081)` to `.WithHostPort(8081)`

## Consistency

This change aligns with the naming convention used across other Aspire hosting packages:
- `Aspire.Hosting.Redis` - uses `WithHostPort` for Redis, RedisCommander, and RedisInsight
- `Aspire.Hosting.MongoDB` - uses `WithHostPort` for MongoExpress
- `Aspire.Hosting.PostgreSQL` - uses `WithHostPort` for various PostgreSQL extensions

## Verification

- ✅ All 44 tests in the Docker hosting test suite pass
- ✅ Build succeeds with no errors or warnings
- ✅ Method functionality remains unchanged - it configures the host port for the primary endpoint
- ✅ Minimal change scope - only 6 insertions and 6 deletions across 2 files

Fixes #9656.

3241986884,10525,Add .NET SDK availability check to Aspire CLI commands,"## Summary

This PR implements SDK availability checking for all Aspire CLI commands to ensure the .NET SDK is present before executing any operations. This is necessary because the Aspire CLI is now distributed as native executables and may be used in environments without a pre-existing .NET SDK installation.

## Changes

### Core Implementation
- **Added `IDotNetSdkInstaller` interface** with `CheckAsync()` and `InstallAsync()` methods for future extensibility
- **Implemented `DotNetSdkInstaller`** that checks for SDK availability using `dotnet --version`
- **Created `SdkInstallHelper`** static class for consistent UX and error messaging
- **Added `ExitCodeConstants.SdkNotInstalled = 11`** for standardized error handling

### Commands Updated
All CLI commands now check for SDK availability at the start of execution:
- `aspire run` - before running app hosts
- `aspire add` - before adding integrations  
- `aspire new` - before creating projects
- `aspire publish` / `aspire deploy` - before publishing/deploying
- `aspire exec` - before executing commands

### User Experience
When the .NET SDK is not found, users see a clear error message:
```
The .NET SDK is required but was not found. Please install the .NET SDK and ensure it's available in your PATH.
```

The command exits with code 11 for automation compatibility.

### Testing
- Added 9 comprehensive tests covering SDK availability scenarios
- All 122 existing CLI tests continue to pass
- Tests verify both SDK present and SDK missing cases
- Manual verification confirms correct behavior

## Example Usage

```bash
# On a system without .NET SDK installed
$ aspire run
The .NET SDK is required but was not found. Please install the .NET SDK and ensure it's available in your PATH.
$ echo $?
11

# On a system with .NET SDK installed
$ aspire run
# Command proceeds normally
```

## Implementation Notes

- Uses existing `IInteractionService.DisplayError()` for consistent messaging
- Follows established dependency injection patterns in the CLI
- Minimal changes to preserve existing functionality
- `InstallAsync()` method reserved for future SDK installation features
- Configuration commands (`aspire config`) intentionally skip SDK check as they manage settings, not build operations

Fixes the issue where Aspire CLI would fail with cryptic errors when the .NET SDK wasn't available in environments using the native executable distribution.

*This pull request was created as a result of the following prompt from Copilot chat.*
> ## Summary of this chat
> 
> The discussion centered on ensuring the Aspire CLI checks for the presence of the .NET SDK before running any command, since Aspire CLI is now distributed as native executables and may be used without a pre-existing SDK. The desired approach is:
> 
> - Introduce an `IDotNetSdkInstaller` interface with two methods: `CheckAsync()` (to check if the .NET SDK is on the path) and `InstallAsync()` (to install the SDK, for future extensibility).
> - Implement a `SdkInstallHelper` class to handle user interaction and UX flow, keeping the installer non-interactive.
> - Use `IInteractionService.DisplayError()` from within `SdkInstallHelper` to display a standard error message if the SDK is missing. In the future, this can be extended to prompt for installation.
> - Add a standard exit code (e.g., `SdkNotInstalled`) to `ExitCodeConstants` and ensure all commands return this code if the SDK is missing.
> - The pattern for commands is to inject `IDotNetSdkInstaller` and `IInteractionService`, then call `SdkInstallHelper.EnsureSdkInstalledAsync(...)` at the top of each command's execution method.
> 
> ## Implementation steps
> 
> 1. Define `IDotNetSdkInstaller` interface.
> 2. Provide a default implementation that checks the path for `dotnet`.
> 3. Create `SdkInstallHelper` static class with `EnsureSdkInstalledAsync` method that uses `IInteractionService.DisplayError` if missing.
> 4. Add `SdkNotInstalled` exit code to `ExitCodeConstants`.
> 5. Update CLI commands to use this pattern (inject installer/service, check at top).
> 
> ---
> 
> **Implement the above as a new PR in the dotnet/aspire repo.**

3079632972,9447,Remove --prerelease switches from aspire CLI commands,"This PR removes the `--prerelease` switch from the `aspire new` and `aspire add` CLI commands while defaulting the `prerelease` parameter to `true` for internal API calls.

## Changes

- Removed the `--prerelease` option from `NewCommand`
- Removed the `--prerelease` option from `AddCommand` 
- Updated `NuGetPackageCache` and `IDotNetCliRunner` interfaces to default `prerelease` to `true` in method signatures
- Updated implementations to use the new default value
- Made the options parameter nullable in SearchPackagesAsync with appropriate handling
- Updated test fixtures to reflect these changes

This approach simplifies the CLI interface while ensuring that prerelease packages are included by default in searches, with the option to change this behavior in the future through the internal API if needed.

Fixes #9446.

3177942149,10059,Fix DevcontainerSettingsWriter directory creation in clean codespace environments,"The `DevcontainerSettingsWriter` was failing in clean codespace environments when attempting to create VS Code settings files because it didn't ensure parent directories existed before file creation.

## Problem
When running `aspire run` in a fresh GitHub Codespace, the application would crash with:
```
System.IO.DirectoryNotFoundException: Could not find a part of the path '/home/vscode/.vscode-remote/data/Machine/settings.json'.
```

This occurred because the `EnsureSettingsFileExists` method attempted to create a file using `File.Open(path, FileMode.CreateNew)` without first ensuring the parent directory structure existed.

## Solution
Added `Directory.CreateDirectory(Path.GetDirectoryName(path)!)` before the file creation attempt. This follows the established pattern used throughout the codebase (e.g., in `DefaultUserSecretsManager.cs`) and is safe because:

- `Directory.CreateDirectory` is idempotent - if directories already exist, it does nothing
- Only creates the minimum required directory structure
- Doesn't change existing behavior when directories are already present

## Testing
Added comprehensive tests that verify:
- Directory creation works when parent directories don't exist
- Existing files are not overwritten
- The original failure scenario is reproduced and demonstrates the fix

The fix is minimal (3 lines added) and surgical, addressing only the specific issue without affecting other functionality.

Fixes #9983.

- [x] Confirmed that `CompiledStateGraph` from `langgraph.graph.state` is a subclass of `CompiledGraph`
- [x] Verified that working test files already use `CompiledStateGraph` import pattern

- [x] Update `mlflow/langchain/chat_agent_langgraph.py` to use correct import
- [x] Update test files to use correct import
- [x] Run tests to verify the fix works

**Root Cause**: The import `from langgraph.graph.graph import CompiledGraph` is failing in some LangGraph versions during cross-version testing. The stable import pattern is `from langgraph.graph.state import CompiledStateGraph`.

**Solution**: Replace all occurrences of `CompiledGraph` imports and type annotations with `CompiledStateGraph` from the correct module, since `CompiledStateGraph` is a subclass of `CompiledGraph` and is what `StateGraph().compile()` actually returns.

**Changes Made**:
- Updated 5 files with minimal import path changes
- All changes preserve existing functionality while using stable import paths
- Verified syntax and import compatibility with current LangGraph version

**Changes:**
- Added `ready_for_review` to the `types` array under `pull_request_target` in `.github/workflows/advice.yml`

**Why this change is needed:**
The advice workflow currently only runs when a PR is opened as a non-draft. However, if someone opens a draft PR and later marks it as ready for review, the advice workflow wouldn't run. This change ensures the workflow runs in both scenarios:
- When a PR is initially opened (existing behavior)
- When a draft PR is marked as ready for review (new behavior)

This follows the same pattern used by other workflows in the repository that need to run when PRs become ready for review.

3105161001,15987,Fix deprecated rlang functions in R package causing warnings,"This PR resolves deprecation warnings that users encounter when using `mlflow_log_metric()` and other MLflow R functions. The warnings were caused by the `forge` package using deprecated `as_integer()` from rlang 0.4.0+.

## Problem
Users reported seeing deprecation warnings like:
```
Warning: `as_integer()` is deprecated as of rlang 0.4.0
Please use `vctrs::vec_cast()` instead.
```

These warnings appeared when calling core MLflow R functions, particularly `mlflow_log_metric()`.

## Root Cause
The MLflow R package depended on the `forge` package for type casting functions (`cast_string()`, `cast_scalar_double()`, etc.). The `forge` package internally uses deprecated rlang functions that trigger these warnings in newer R environments.

## Solution
- **Replaced forge dependency** with custom casting utilities that use standard R functions
- **Created `cast-utils.R`** with modern implementations of all required casting functions
- **Updated all affected files** to use the new casting functions
- **Maintained full API compatibility** - no breaking changes for users

## Functions Replaced
| Old (forge) | New (standard R) |
|-------------|------------------|
| `forge::cast_string()` | `cast_string()` using `as.character()` |
| `forge::cast_scalar_double()` | `cast_scalar_double()` using `as.numeric()` |
| `forge::cast_nullable_scalar_double()` | `cast_nullable_scalar_double()` |
| `forge::cast_string_list()` | `cast_string_list()` |
| `forge::cast_choice()` | `cast_choice()` |

## Files Changed
- `DESCRIPTION` - Removed forge dependency
- `NAMESPACE` - Removed forge import
- `R/cast-utils.R` - New casting utilities (created)
- `R/tracking-runs.R` - Updated `mlflow_log_metric()` and related functions
- `R/model-registry.R` - Updated model registry functions
- `R/project-param.R` - Updated parameter handling
- `R/tracking-experiments.R` - Updated experiment functions
- `tests/testthat/test-cast-utils.R` - Comprehensive tests for new functions

## Testing
- Added comprehensive unit tests for all new casting functions
- Existing MLflow functionality tests ensure no regressions
- All casting functions maintain identical behavior to forge equivalents

## Impact
✅ **Eliminates deprecation warnings** when using MLflow R functions  
✅ **Removes unnecessary dependency** on forge package  
✅ **Uses modern, standard R functions** instead of deprecated rlang functions  
✅ **Maintains full backward compatibility** for all users  

Fixes #15969.

```

This would fail with ""file not found"" because there is no `build-rdoc.sh` script in the `docs/` directory.

```

## Verification
- ✅ Script exists at `docs/api_reference/build-rdoc.sh`
- ✅ Script is executable and accessible from `docs/` directory
- ✅ Other workflows (CircleCI, Makefile) already use the correct path/working directory
- ✅ No other similar path issues found in the autoformat workflow

3105220570,15991,Fix autoformat workflow to include untracked files in patch,"The autoformat workflow's ""Create patch"" step was not including untracked files in the generated patch. This caused issues when autoformatting processes create new files (such as auto-generated protobuf files, formatted JavaScript files, or other generated content) since these files would not be included in the patch and therefore not pushed back to the PR.

## Problem

The current implementation uses:
```bash
git diff > ${{ github.run_id }}.diff
```

This only captures changes to tracked files, missing any new untracked files created during the autoformatting process.

## Solution

Modified the ""Create patch"" step to stage all changes before creating the patch:
```bash
git add .
git diff --cached > ${{ github.run_id }}.diff
```

This ensures that both modified tracked files and newly created untracked files are included in the patch.

## Testing

Created comprehensive tests demonstrating:
- ✅ Old approach misses untracked files
- ✅ New approach captures both tracked and untracked files  
- ✅ Patches created with the new approach apply correctly via `git apply`
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing workflow functionality

The change is minimal (2 lines added, 1 removed) and maintains full compatibility with the existing patch application logic in the push step.

The issue was in the `git commit -sam` command which only stages modifications to already tracked files, ignoring any new files created by autoformatting tools.

## Root Cause

In `.github/workflows/autoformat.yml`, the workflow:

1. Uses `git add -N .` to include untracked files in the diff/patch
2. Creates a patch with `git diff` that includes both modified and new files  
3. Applies the patch with `git apply`, which creates the new files but doesn't stage them
4. Commits with `git commit -sam`, where the `-a` flag only stages tracked file modifications

This meant that any new files created during autoformatting (like generated configs, documentation, etc.) would be created but not committed.

## Solution

Replace `git commit -sam` with:
```bash
git add .
git commit -sm
```

This explicitly stages all files (including untracked ones) before committing, ensuring that any files created during the autoformatting process are properly included in the commit.

## Testing

Created test scripts that reproduce the issue and verify the fix works correctly by simulating the exact workflow steps with both modified and newly created files.

Fixes #15992.

3239660273,10499,Fix IInteractionService API limitations in CLI by making unsupported interactions fail instead of silently returning,"## Problem

In `PublishingActivityReporter.cs`, unsupported interaction types (MessageBox, Notification, Confirmation) were being silently ignored instead of properly failing. The `HandleInteractionUpdateAsync` method at line 268 had:

```csharp
if (interaction.InteractionInfo is not Interaction.InputsInteractionInfo inputsInfo || inputsInfo.Inputs.Count == 0)
{
    return; // Silent ignore - this was the problem
}
```

This meant that when CLI publishing encountered unsupported interaction types, they would be silently dropped rather than providing clear feedback to the user.

## Solution

Modified the method to complete unsupported interactions with an error state using the same pattern as existing error handling (lines 275-284):

```csharp
if (interaction.InteractionInfo is not Interaction.InputsInteractionInfo inputsInfo || inputsInfo.Inputs.Count == 0)
{
    await _interactionService.CompleteInteractionAsync(interaction.InteractionId, (interaction, ServiceProvider) =>
    {
        // Complete the interaction with an error state
        interaction.CompletionTcs.TrySetException(new InvalidOperationException(""Unsupported interaction type. Only input interactions are supported during publishing.""));
        return new InteractionCompletionState
        {
            Complete = true,
            State = ""Unsupported interaction type. Only input interactions are supported during publishing.""
        };
    }, cancellationToken).ConfigureAwait(false);
    return;
}
```

## Changes

- **Fixed**: `PublishingActivityReporter.HandleInteractionUpdateAsync` now properly fails unsupported interactions
- **Added**: Test `HandleInteractionUpdateAsync_UnsupportedInteractionTypes_FailWithError` to verify the new behavior
- **Consistent**: Uses the same error completion pattern as existing error handling

## Testing

- All existing PublishingActivityReporter tests continue to pass (29/29) ✅
- New test validates that MessageBox, Notification, and Confirmation interactions now fail with appropriate error messages ✅
- No regressions in supported InputsInteractionInfo functionality ✅

Fixes #10461.

3238012390,10485,Improve friendly name generation for `aspire add` command add introduce pre-release package sub-menu.,"## Summary

This PR refactors the `GenerateFriendlyName` logic in the `aspire add` command to implement a simplified algorithm that removes vendor-specific prefixes and creates more intuitive package names.


https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f8759d56-8361-4df1-b7bf-ad550b55f69c



## Changes

### Old Logic
The previous implementation used prefix-based mapping:
- `Aspire.Hosting.Azure.*` → `az-{lastSegment}`
- `Aspire.Hosting.AWS.*` → `aws-{lastSegment}`  
- `CommunityToolkit.Aspire.Hosting.*` → `ct-{lastSegment}`
- Other packages → `{lastSegment}`

### New Logic
The new implementation uses a uniform approach:
1. Remove `Aspire.Hosting` from anywhere in the package name
2. Replace all dots (.) with dashes (-)
3. Convert to lowercase
4. Handle edge cases like consecutive dots

## Example Transformations

| Package Name | Old Result | New Result |
|--------------|------------|------------|
| `Aspire.Hosting.Azure.Redis` | `az-redis` | `azure-redis` |
| `CommunityToolkit.Aspire.Hosting.Cosmos` | `ct-cosmos` | `communitytoolkit-cosmos` |
| `Aspire.Hosting.Postgres` | `postgres` | `postgres` |
| `Acme.Aspire.Hosting.Foo.Bar` | `bar` | `acme-foo-bar` |

## Benefits

- **More descriptive**: Friendly names now include the full context (e.g., `azure-redis` vs `az-redis`)
- **Consistent**: No special-casing for different vendors
- **Intuitive**: Users can easily map friendly names back to package names
- **Unique**: Reduces collision risk by including more package context

## Testing

- Added comprehensive theory-based tests covering all transformation scenarios
- All existing tests pass, ensuring backward compatibility
- Verified the CLI command continues to work correctly with new friendly names

## Files Changed

- `src/Aspire.Cli/Commands/AddCommand.cs` - Updated `GenerateFriendlyName` method
- `tests/Aspire.Cli.Tests/Commands/AddCommandTests.cs` - Added test coverage for new logic

*This pull request was created as a result of the following prompt from Copilot chat.*
> Refactor the GenerateFriendlyName logic for the 'aspire add' command to simplify and make friendly names unique.
> 
> **Requirements:**
> - For a given package name, remove the 'Aspire.Hosting' segment (anywhere in the package name).
> - Replace all dots (.) with dashes (-).
> - Convert the result to lower case.
> - Ensure the new logic is used everywhere friendly names are generated for package display/selection.
> - Remove any obsolete or unnecessary prefix logic from the old implementation.
> 
> Example transformations:
> - 'Aspire.Hosting.Azure.Redis' → 'azure-redis'
> - 'CommunityToolkit.Aspire.Hosting.Cosmos' → 'communitytoolkit-cosmos'
> - 'Aspire.Hosting.Postgres' → 'postgres'
> - 'Acme.Aspire.Hosting.Foo.Bar' → 'acme-foo-bar'
> 
> Update tests if they exist or add a simple test case if none exist.
> 
> Task:
> - Replace the current GenerateFriendlyName method with the new simplified logic as described.
> - Ensure all usages now use the new friendly name format.
> - Update/add test(s) to verify the new logic and prevent regressions.

This update enhances the script to show the complete release timestamp in YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS format for more precise release information.

**Changes made:**
- Modified `get_release_date()` function to return full timestamp by replacing ""T"" with "" "" instead of splitting on ""T""
- Updated column header from ""Release Date"" to ""Release Timestamp"" 
- Updated variable names and column width calculations to accommodate the longer timestamp format

**Output comparison:**

Before:
```

--------------------------------------
aiohttp           3.12.4  2025-05-29

3161638137,9965,Add ExternalServiceResource for modeling external services with service discovery support,"This PR introduces a new `ExternalServiceResource` type that allows developers to model external services (APIs, databases, etc.) in their Aspire applications with service discovery support.

## Problem

Previously, developers had to create custom implementations to represent external services in their Aspire applications:

```csharp
public class ResourceWithServiceDiscovery : IResourceWithServiceDiscovery
{
    public required string Name { get; init; }
    public required ResourceMetadataCollection Annotations { get; init; }
}

var remoteResource = new ResourceWithServiceDiscovery
{
    Name = ""someremoteresource"",
    Annotations = [
        new AllocatedEndpointAnnotation(
            ""http"",
            ProtocolType.Tcp,
            remoteHubConfig.GetValue(""Address"")!,
            remoteHubConfig.GetValue<int>(""Port""),
            remoteHubConfig.GetValue<string>(""Scheme"")!)
    ]
};
```

## Solution

Added `ExternalServiceResource` and `AddExternalService` extension methods that provide a clean, built-in way to model external services:

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Basic usage with literal URL
var weatherApi = builder.AddExternalService(""weatherapi"", ""https://api.weather.gov/"");

// With Uri object
var weatherApi = builder.AddExternalService(""weatherapi"", new Uri(""https://api.weather.gov/""))
    // Support for HTTP health checks
    .WithHttpHealthCheck(path: ""/health"");

// With parameterized URL
var urlParam = builder.AddParameter(""weather-url"");
var weatherApi = builder.AddExternalService(""weatherapi"", urlParam);

// Service discovery integration
builder.AddProject<Projects.MyWeatherApp>(""webapp"")
    .WithReference(weatherApi)  // Injects service discovery configuration
    .WithExternalHttpEndpoints();

// Environment variable support  
builder.AddProject<Projects.MyWeatherApp>(""webapp"")
    .WithEnvironment(""WEATHER_URL"", weatherApi);
```

## Features

- **Multiple overloads** for different use cases (string URL, Uri, parameter-based)
- **URL validation** at build time with helpful error messages
- **Service discovery integration** via `WithReference()` - works seamlessly with existing service discovery infrastructure
- **Dashboard integration** - external services appear in the Aspire dashboard with unique icon, etc.
- **Parameterization support** - URLs can be parameterized for different environments

Fixes #2311

3086457034,15865,Add PR comments when validate-author action fails,"## Changes

This PR enhances the validate-author GitHub Action to leave comments on pull requests when validation fails, providing clearer feedback to contributors.

Previously, when a user without the necessary permissions (non-owner, non-member, non-collaborator) triggered a workflow requiring validation, the action would fail silently from the PR's perspective - only showing a failure in the GitHub Actions logs.

Now, when validation fails for any reason, a clear comment is added to the PR explaining why:

- When a comment author is not allowed to trigger the workflow
- When a PR is from an author who is not allowed to use the workflow
- When an unsupported event triggers the workflow

### Implementation details

- Added a new `createFailureComment` helper function that creates comments with a consistent format
- Modified each validation failure point to create a comment with the same message that fails the workflow
- Added error handling to ensure that comment creation failures don't affect the original workflow failure logic
- The comment format uses a red ❌ icon for visual clarity and includes ""Validation Failed"" prefix

Fixes #15864.

- Add a method to dynamically get the user's home directory using `Environment.GetFolderPath(Environment.SpecialFolder.UserProfile)`
- Update path construction in `GetSettingsPaths()` to use the actual user's home directory
- Add detailed comments explaining the approach

## Before

```csharp
private const string CodespaceSettingsPath = ""/home/vscode/.vscode-remote/data/Machine/settings.json"";
private const string VSCodeServerPath = ""/home/vscode/.vscode-server"";
private const string VSCodeInsidersServerPath = ""/home/vscode/.vscode-server-insiders"";
```

## After

```csharp
private const string VscodeRemotePathSegment = "".vscode-remote/data/Machine/settings.json"";
private const string VscodeServerPathSegment = "".vscode-server"";
private const string VscodeInsidersServerPathSegment = "".vscode-server-insiders"";

private static string GetUserHomeDirectory() => 
    Environment.GetFolderPath(Environment.SpecialFolder.UserProfile);
```

This ensures Aspire will work properly regardless of the username specified in the Dev Container or Codespace configuration.

Fixes #9533.

3101311810,9573,Remove 37 unused resources from .resx files,"This PR removes 37 unused resource strings that were identified across multiple `.resx` files in the codebase. These resources were defined in the resource files but never referenced in any code, contributing to unnecessary bloat.

## Changes Made

Removed unused resources from the following files:

- **StructuredLogs.resx**: 4 entries (`StructuredLogsFilters`, `StructuredLogsNoFilters`, `StructuredLogsAddFilter`, `StructuredLogsEditFilter`)
- **ControlsStrings.resx**: 6 entries (`ChartContainerSelectFilters`, `MetricTableShowLatestValues`, `TraceDetailAttributesHeader`, etc.)
- **Columns.resx**: 12 entries (`UrlsColumnDisplayPlaceholder`, `ResourceNameDisplayProcessIdText`, etc.)
- **Layout.resx**: 1 entry (`NavMenuMonitoringTab`)
- **Metrics.resx**: 1 entry (`MetricsLastTwentyFourHours`)
- **ConsoleLogs.resx**: 2 entries (`ConsoleLogsInitializingLogViewer`, `ConsoleLogsFailedToInitialize`)
- **Resources.resx**: 6 entries (`ResourcesEnvironmentVariablesHeader`, `ResourceDetailsEndpointUrl`, etc.)
- **Dialogs.resx**: 2 entries (`FilterDialogEnableFilterButtonText`, `SettingsDialogEnableTelemetry`)
- **TraceDetail.resx**: 2 entries (`SpanLinksTooltip`, `SpanEventsTooltip`)
- **Hosting Resources.resx**: 3 entries (`ContainerRuntimePrerequisiteMissingExceptionMessage`, etc.)

## Verification

- Created automated script to scan all source files and confirm no references to these resources exist in the codebase
- Verified full build succeeds with 0 warnings/errors after removal
- Changes are minimal with 118 lines deleted and only 6 lines added (spacing adjustments)

Fixes #9572.

3101423103,9574,ci: set commit-message in refresh-manifests workflow,"## Summary

This PR adds the missing `commit-message` parameter to the ""Create or update pull request"" step in the refresh-manifests workflow.

## Changes

- Added `commit-message: ""[Automated] Update Manifests""` parameter to the `dotnet/actions-create-pull-request` step in `.github/workflows/refresh-manifests.yml`
- The commit message value matches the existing `title` parameter for consistency

## Details

The `commit-message` parameter was missing from the refresh-manifests workflow, which could result in generic commit messages when the workflow creates or updates pull requests. This change ensures that commits made by this automated workflow have a clear, descriptive message that matches the PR title.

This change aligns with the pattern used in other workflows in the repository, such as `update-dependencies.yml`, which already includes the `commit-message` parameter.

## Testing

- ✅ YAML syntax validation passed
- ✅ Repository builds successfully with no warnings or errors
- ✅ No other workflow logic or parameters were modified

The change is minimal and surgical - only one line was added to maintain consistency with existing automated workflows.

3094144121,15909,Replace `pre-commit install` with `pre-commit install --install-hooks`,"This PR adds the `--install-hooks` flag to all `pre-commit install` commands in the repository. 

This change ensures that all pre-commit hooks are installed immediately when running the install command, rather than waiting until they are first executed. This makes the development environment setup more efficient and predictable, as hooks are ready to use right away.

The changes are applied to:
- `dev/dev-env-setup.sh`
- `.devcontainer/postCreate.sh`
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- GitHub workflow files:
  - `.github/workflows/autoformat.yml`
  - `.github/workflows/copilot-setup-steps.yml`
  - `.github/workflows/lint.yml`

For more details on this flag, see: https://pre-commit.com/#pre-commit-install-hooks

Fixes #15908.

3115762277,9676,Add aspire config commands for managing configuration settings,"This PR implements the `aspire config set` and `aspire config get` commands to provide centralized configuration management for Aspire projects.

## Changes

- **New Configuration Service**: Added `IConfigurationService` interface and `ConfigurationService` implementation that manages `.aspire/settings.json` files
- **Config Commands**: Implemented `ConfigCommand` with `set` and `get` subcommands following existing CLI patterns
- **Integration**: Updated `RootCommand` and DI registration to include the new configuration functionality
- **Tests**: Added comprehensive tests for configuration functionality

## Usage

```bash
# Set a configuration value
aspire config set key value

# Get a configuration value  
aspire config get key

# Set a global value
aspire config set --global key value

# List all values
aspire config list

# Delete a value
aspire config delete key

# Delete a global key
aspire config delete --global key

# View help
aspire config --help
```

## Features

- **Repository Local**: Uses the same directory traversal logic as existing commands to find the nearest `.aspire/settings.json` file
- **Configuration Hierarchy**: Child directories inherit configuration from parent directories, with closer files taking precedence
- **Automatic File Creation**: Creates `.aspire` directory and `settings.json` file when setting values if they don't exist
- **Standard Integration**: Leverages .NET configuration system for reading values and JSON source generation for AOT compatibility
- **Error Handling**: Proper validation and error messages for missing keys and invalid operations

## Example

```bash
cd my-aspire-project
aspire config set defaultRuntime docker
aspire config get defaultRuntime  # outputs: docker
```

The implementation follows the existing CLI architecture patterns and integrates seamlessly with the current configuration discovery mechanism used by `aspire run`, `aspire add`, and `aspire publish`.

Fixes #8832.

3244879925,10554,Update Aspire.Hosting README.md with comprehensive Application Model Overview,"This PR updates the `src/Aspire.Hosting/README.md` file to provide developers with a clear and comprehensive overview of Aspire's application model concepts, replacing the generic documentation reference with detailed explanations and a direct link to the full specification.

## Changes Made

- **Replaced** the generic ""Additional documentation"" section with a new ""Aspire Application Model Overview"" section
- **Added** comprehensive explanations of key Aspire concepts:
  - Resources as the fundamental units of the app model
  - Annotations for extensible metadata
  - Fluent extension methods for composition
  - Resource graph modeling dependencies as a DAG
  - Deferral and structured values for configuration
  - Standard interfaces for polymorphic behaviors
  - Lifecycle events and resource orchestration
- **Updated** documentation link to point directly to the [App Model specification](https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/blob/main/docs/specs/appmodel.md)
- **Preserved** all existing content including package description and feedback/contributing sections

## Benefits

This update provides immediate value to developers by:
- Giving a concise yet comprehensive overview of Aspire's core concepts
- Helping developers understand the application model without needing to dive into the full specification first
- Providing a clear path to more detailed information via the linked specification
- Maintaining the existing guidance about package usage and contribution

The README now serves as an effective entry point for understanding Aspire's application model while directing users to the complete specification for implementation details.

> ## Aspire Application Model Overview
> 
> Aspire models distributed applications as a graph of **resources**—services, infrastructure elements, and supporting components—using strongly-typed, extensible abstractions. Resources are inert data objects that describe capabilities, configuration, and relationships. Developers compose applications using fluent extension methods (like `AddProject`, `AddPostgres`, etc.), wire dependencies explicitly, and attach metadata through annotations to drive orchestration, configuration, and deployment.
> 
> Key concepts include:
> 
> - **Resources:** The fundamental unit representing a service or component in the app model.
> - **Annotations:** Extensible metadata attached to resources to express capabilities and configuration.
> - **Fluent extension methods:** APIs like `AddX`, `WithReference`, and `WithEnvironment` that guide correct resource composition and wiring.
> - **Resource graph:** An explicit, developer-authored Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) that models dependencies and value flows.
> - **Deferral and structured values:** Configuration and connectivity are expressed using structured references, allowing for deferred evaluation and environment-specific resolution at publish and run time.
> - **Standard interfaces:** Optional interfaces enable polymorphic behaviors, such as environment wiring and endpoint exposure, for both built-in and custom resources.
> - **Lifecycle events and resource states:** The Aspire runtime orchestrates resource startup, readiness, health, and shutdown in a predictable, observable way.
> 
> Aspire's approach ensures flexibility, strong tooling support, and clear separation between modeling, orchestration, and execution of distributed .NET applications.

3193746300,10172,Fix Debug.Assert with side effects in ExtensionInteractionService,"## Problem

The `ExtensionInteractionService` class was using `Debug.Assert()` to execute code with side effects. This is problematic because:

1. **Release build failure**: `Debug.Assert()` only executes in debug builds, so all extension backchannel communication would be silently broken in release/production builds
2. **Poor error handling**: Even in debug builds, assertion failures would terminate the process rather than gracefully handling channel write failures

The problematic pattern was used in 14 locations throughout the class:

```csharp
Debug.Assert(_extensionTaskChannel.Writer.TryWrite(() => _backchannel.DisplaySuccessAsync(...)));
```

## Solution

1. **Removed Debug.Assert wrapper**: All `TryWrite` calls now execute directly in all build configurations
2. **Added proper error handling**: Created a `TryWriteToExtensionChannel` helper method that logs warnings when channel writes fail
3. **Added logging support**: Extended the constructor to accept `ILogger<ExtensionInteractionService>` for proper error reporting
4. **Updated dependency injection**: Modified `Program.cs` to provide the logger when creating the service

## Changes

- **ExtensionInteractionService.cs**:
  - Added `ILogger<ExtensionInteractionService>` parameter to constructor
  - Added `TryWriteToExtensionChannel` helper method with warning logging
  - Replaced all 14 `Debug.Assert(TryWrite(...))` calls with direct `TryWriteToExtensionChannel(...)` calls
  - Removed unused `System.Diagnostics` using directive

- **Program.cs**:
  - Updated dependency injection to provide logger to `ExtensionInteractionService`

- **ExtensionInteractionServiceTests.cs** (new):
  - Added comprehensive tests validating the fix works correctly
  - Tests verify logging behavior when channel operations fail
  - Tests confirm operations execute in all build configurations

## Verification

- ✅ All existing tests pass (102/102)
- ✅ New tests validate the fix works correctly
- ✅ Build succeeds in both debug and release configurations
- ✅ Extension backchannel communication now works reliably in production

This fix ensures that extension integration features work correctly in all deployment scenarios, not just during development.

3223342785,10336,Make parameters and connection strings visible in dashboard,"This PR makes parameters and connection strings visible in the Aspire dashboard by removing the `IsHidden = true` settings that were previously hiding them by default.

## Background

Previously, parameters and connection strings were hidden from the dashboard because:
1. Individual resources added hidden parameters that cluttered the view
2. The dashboard lacked the ability to show hierarchy

Now that the dashboard supports hierarchy display, these resources should be visible as they contain valuable configuration properties that are useful to developers.

## Changes Made

1. **ParameterResourceBuilderExtensions.cs**: Removed `IsHidden = true` from parameter resources - they are now visible by default
2. **ConnectionStringBuilderExtensions.cs**: Removed `IsHidden = true` from connection string resources - they are now visible by default  
3. **ParameterProcessor.cs**: Removed `IsHidden = false` from error handling since resources are visible by default
4. **Tests**: Updated existing test and added new test to verify the new visibility behavior

## Before vs After

**Before**: Parameters and connection strings only appeared in the dashboard when there were errors or missing values, making it look odd and providing limited visibility into configuration.

**After**: Parameters and connection strings are always visible in the dashboard, showing their valuable properties and providing better insight into the application's configuration.

All existing tests pass, confirming the changes don't break existing functionality while providing the intended improved visibility.

Fixes #10335.

The change is motivated by the fact that Aspire might be used by people without much .NET experience who may not need to know that Aspire is built with .NET under the covers. Using `.aspire` as the directory name presents a more straightforward and accessible path.

The changes were straightforward, affecting only two files:
1. `src/Aspire.Cli/DotNetCliRunner.cs` - Updated the path for backchannel unix sockets
2. `tests/Aspire.Hosting.Tests/Utils/UnixSocketHelper.cs` - Updated the corresponding test utility

This change only affects the directory structure where temporary files like backchannel sockets are stored, and does not impact functionality. It's important to note that this is not related to the `.aspire/settings.json` file that's used in the current working directory to cache app host discovery.

Fixes #9504.

3127222871,5705,Fix MTP timeout parsing to use invariant culture instead of current culture,"The `--timeout` option parsing was using the current culture for `float.TryParse()`, which could cause parsing failures in locales that use different decimal separators (e.g., comma instead of period in German locale).

## Changes Made

Fixed two locations where timeout values are parsed:

1. **`PlatformCommandLineProvider.cs`** - Validation logic now uses `CultureInfo.InvariantCulture`
2. **`TestHostBuilder.cs`** - Parsing logic now uses `CultureInfo.InvariantCulture`

## Before
```csharp
// This would fail in German locale for ""1.5s""
float.TryParse(arg[..(size - 1)], out float value)
```

## After  
```csharp
// This works consistently across all locales
float.TryParse(arg[..(size - 1)], CultureInfo.InvariantCulture, out float value)
```

## Tests Added

Added comprehensive unit tests to verify:
- Valid timeout formats work across different cultures (en-US, de-DE, fr-FR)
- Invalid formats including culture-specific decimal separators are rejected
- Parsing specifically uses invariant culture vs current culture

The fix ensures that timeout values like `--timeout 1.5s` work consistently regardless of the user's system locale.

Fixes #5451.

## Changes Made

### 1. Mark DataTestMethodAttribute as Obsolete
- Added `[Obsolete]` attribute to `DataTestMethodAttribute` with diagnostic ID `MSTEST0044`
- Provides clear migration message directing users to use `[TestMethod]` instead

### 2. New Analyzer: PreferTestMethodOverDataTestMethodAnalyzer
- Detects all usages of `[DataTestMethod]` attribute
- Reports warnings with diagnostic ID `MSTEST0044`
- Works for both C# and Visual Basic

### 3. New Code Fix Provider: PreferTestMethodOverDataTestMethodFixer
- **Scenario 1**: When only `[DataTestMethod]` exists → Replace with `[TestMethod]`
- **Scenario 2**: When both `[TestMethod]` and `[DataTestMethod]` exist → Remove `[DataTestMethod]`
- Handles edge cases like multiple attributes in the same attribute list

### 4. Comprehensive Test Coverage
- 8 test methods covering all scenarios including:
  - Single `[DataTestMethod]` usage
  - `[DataTestMethod]` with parameterized tests
  - Both attributes existing together
  - Code fix validation for all scenarios

## Example

**Before:**
```csharp
[DataTestMethod]
[DataRow(1, 2)]
public void MyTest(int a, int b) { }
```

**After (with code fix):**
```csharp
[TestMethod]
[DataRow(1, 2)]
public void MyTest(int a, int b) { }
```

This provides a smooth migration path for users while maintaining full backward compatibility until the attribute is removed in v4.

3127353854,5708,Fix UseAsync property in TestMethodAttribute derived classes to use type checks,"## Summary

This PR fixes an issue where custom `TestMethodAttribute` derived classes were incorrectly falling back to synchronous execution instead of using their async implementations.

## Problem

The `TestMethodAttribute` constructor sets `UseAsync = GetType() == typeof(TestMethodAttribute)`, which evaluates to `false` for derived classes. However, derived classes like `UITestMethodAttribute`, `DataTestMethodAttribute`, and `STATestMethodAttribute` were overriding the `UseAsync` property to return `true` directly:

```csharp
private protected override bool UseAsync => true;  // Problematic
```

This caused inconsistent behavior where the framework would fall back to the synchronous `Execute` method instead of using the asynchronous `ExecuteAsync` method that these attributes implement.

## Solution

Updated all derived `TestMethodAttribute` classes to use the same type-checking pattern as the base class:

```csharp
// Before
private protected override bool UseAsync => true;

// After  
private protected override bool UseAsync => GetType() == typeof(UITestMethodAttribute);
```

This ensures that:
- Only the exact type uses the async execution path
- Classes that derive from these attributes must explicitly opt in to async behavior
- Behavior is consistent with the base `TestMethodAttribute` constructor logic

## Files Changed

- `UWP_UITestMethodAttribute.cs`: UseAsync now checks for exact `UITestMethodAttribute` type
- `WinUI_UITestMethodAttribute.cs`: UseAsync now checks for exact `UITestMethodAttribute` type  
- `DataTestMethodAttribute.cs`: UseAsync now checks for exact `DataTestMethodAttribute` type
- `STATestMethodAttribute.cs`: UseAsync now checks for exact `STATestMethodAttribute` type

Each change is minimal and surgical - exactly one line modified per file.

## Impact

This fix ensures that custom test method attributes properly use their async execution paths, which is especially important for UI testing scenarios where execution must happen on specific threads.

Fixes #5707.

3164935344,16367,Use Resolver for TYPE_CHECKING Detection in clint linter,"<details><summary>&#x1F6E0 DevTools &#x1F6E0</summary>
<p>

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/Copilot/mlflow/pull/16367?quickstart=1)

#### Install mlflow from this PR

```
# mlflow
pip install git+https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow.git@refs/pull/16367/merge
# mlflow-skinny
pip install git+https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow.git@refs/pull/16367/merge#subdirectory=skinny
```

For Databricks, use the following command:

```
%sh curl -LsSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mlflow/mlflow/HEAD/dev/install-skinny.sh | sh -s pull/16367/merge
```

</p>
</details>

## Problem

The clint linter's TYPE_CHECKING detection was hardcoded to only recognize direct usage of the name `TYPE_CHECKING`. This missed valid uses of TYPE_CHECKING with aliases or module imports:

```python
# ✅ Previously worked
from typing import TYPE_CHECKING
if TYPE_CHECKING:
    import some_module

# ❌ Previously missed
from typing import TYPE_CHECKING as TC
if TC:
    import some_module

# ❌ Previously missed  
import typing
if typing.TYPE_CHECKING:
    import some_module
```

## Solution

Enhanced the `visit_If` method in `dev/clint/src/clint/linter.py` to use the existing resolver for proper import resolution:

**Before:**
```python
def visit_If(self, node: ast.If) -> None:
    if isinstance(node.test, ast.Name) and node.test.id == ""TYPE_CHECKING"":
        self.in_TYPE_CHECKING = True
    self.generic_visit(node)
    self.in_TYPE_CHECKING = False
```

**After:**
```python
def visit_If(self, node: ast.If) -> None:
    # Check if this is a TYPE_CHECKING condition
    # Resolve the test condition to check for TYPE_CHECKING
    if resolved := self.resolver.resolve(node.test):
        # Check if it resolves to typing.TYPE_CHECKING
        if resolved == [""typing"", ""TYPE_CHECKING""]:
            self.in_TYPE_CHECKING = True

    self.generic_visit(node)
    self.in_TYPE_CHECKING = False
```

## Testing

Validated all documented scenarios now work correctly:

- ✅ Direct import: `from typing import TYPE_CHECKING`
- ✅ Import with alias: `from typing import TYPE_CHECKING as TC`  
- ✅ Module import: `import typing; if typing.TYPE_CHECKING:`
- ✅ Multiple TYPE_CHECKING blocks with different aliases
- ✅ Nested conditions within TYPE_CHECKING blocks
- ✅ Mixed import patterns in the same file

Confirmed no regressions by testing existing mlflow files that use TYPE_CHECKING.

Fixes #16366.

3087761233,9498,Fix malformed table output in aspire run command when no resources are present,"## Issue

When running `aspire run` with a freshly created Aspire app host (or any configuration where no resources are present), the CLI displays a malformed/empty table after pressing CTRL-C to stop the host. This results in a poor user experience, showing broken table borders instead of useful information.

## Root Cause

The table output is based on an `IAsyncEnumerable` of resource states. When there are no resources, this enumerable yields no results, but the code was still attempting to render a table with columns but no rows.

## Changes

This PR fixes the issue by:

1. Starting with a ""No resources are present"" message by default
2. Adding a flag to track if any resources are found during enumeration
3. Only switching to displaying the table when resources are actually found
4. Keeping the existing CTRL-C message for clarity

## Result

With this change:
- If no resources are present, users will see a clear ""No resources are present"" message
- The malformed/empty table no longer appears after CTRL-C
- When resources are present, behavior is unchanged (the table is displayed as before)

This provides a more user-friendly experience, especially for new users working with the default Aspire template.

Fixes #9497.

The test was identified as flaky and needs to be moved from regular test runs to the outerloop workflow to prevent CI failures while the underlying issue is being investigated.

**Changes made:**
- Added `[QuarantinedTest(""https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/issues/9772"")]` attribute to the test method
- The test will now run only in the outerloop workflow (`tests-outerloop.yml`) instead of regular tests (`tests.yml`)
- Follows the existing pattern used for other quarantined tests in the same file

The change is minimal and surgical - exactly one line added with no other modifications to preserve existing functionality.

## Changes Made

Updated two `DisplayMessage` calls in `src/Aspire.Cli/Templating/DotNetTemplateFactory.cs`:

- **PromptForRedisCacheOptionAsync**: Changed `""french_fries""` to `""check_mark""` when displaying Redis cache confirmation message
- **PromptForTestFrameworkOptionsAsync**: Changed `""french_fries""` to `""check_mark""` when displaying test framework selection confirmation message

## Rationale

The french fries emoji was semantically inappropriate for success/confirmation messages in the CLI output. The checkmark emoji better represents successful selection or confirmation of user choices during template creation.

## Impact

- **Visual**: Users will now see ✅ instead of 🍟 when confirming Redis cache usage and test framework selection
- **Functional**: No behavioral changes - this is purely a visual/UX improvement
- **Compatibility**: No breaking changes to CLI functionality or API

The changes follow existing Spectre.Console emoji alias patterns used throughout the codebase (`:check_mark:` format).

3275318710,10737,Don't run expensive build/test workflows for markdown-only changes,"Currently, the main `Tests` workflow runs on every pull request, including those that only modify markdown files. This wastes significant CPU resources running expensive build operations, integration tests, and end-to-end tests across multiple platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows) when only documentation has changed.

This PR optimizes the GitHub Actions configuration by adding `paths-ignore` filters to exclude markdown files (`**/*.md`) from triggering the comprehensive test suite in `.github/workflows/tests.yml`.

**Changes:**
- Added `paths-ignore: - '**/*.md'` to both `pull_request` and `push` triggers in the Tests workflow
- Markdown changes will now only run the lightweight `markdownlint` workflow (which was already configured correctly)
- Code changes continue to run the full test suite as before

**Impact:**
- Significantly reduces CI resource usage for documentation-only PRs
- Faster feedback for markdown changes (only linting instead of full build+test)
- No functionality loss - all code changes still get full test coverage
- The existing markdownlint workflow ensures markdown quality is maintained

**Example scenarios:**
- PR updating only `README.md` → Only markdownlint runs ✅
- PR updating `docs/setup.md` → Only markdownlint runs ✅  
- PR updating `.cs` files → Full test suite runs ✅
- PR updating both `.md` and `.cs` files → Full test suite runs ✅

Fixes #10736.

</details>

This PR addresses the TODO comment in `.github/workflows/patch.js` that needed to be resolved after MLflow 3.0.0 was officially released.

## Problem

The patch workflow was filtering out releases that start with ""v3"" to avoid selecting pre-release or beta versions of MLflow 3.0.0:

```javascript
// TODO: Remove this line once MLflow 3.0.0 is released
const latest = releases.data.find(({ tag_name }) => !tag_name.startsWith(""v3""));
```

This meant the script was incorrectly identifying v2.x releases (e.g., v2.22.1) as the ""latest"" release instead of the actual latest v3.x releases.

## Solution

Since MLflow 3.0.0 and 3.1.0 have been officially released, this special handling is no longer needed. The change replaces the filtered logic with the standard approach:

```javascript
const latest = releases.data[0];
```

## Impact

- **Before**: Script would create patch labels based on the latest v2.x release (e.g., v2.22.2)
- **After**: Script correctly creates patch labels based on the actual latest release (e.g., v3.1.1)

This is a minimal change (1 line added, 2 lines removed) that restores the intended behavior now that MLflow 3.0.0 is stable.

Fixes #16264.

3201684625,5935,Fix MSTEST0020 codefix placing code in static constructors,"The MSTEST0020 codefix for ""PreferConstructorOverTestInitialize"" was incorrectly placing TestInitialize method code into static constructors when both static and instance constructors existed in a test class.

## Problem
When applying the codefix to code like this:

```csharp
[TestClass]
public sealed class Test1
{
    private object _instanceVariable;

    static Test1()
    {
    }

    [TestInitialize]
    public void Initialize()
    {
        _instanceVariable = new object();
    }
}
```

The codefix would incorrectly place the instance variable assignment in the static constructor:

```csharp
static Test1()
{
    _instanceVariable = new object(); // ERROR: Can't access instance members in static context
}
```

## Root Cause
The issue was in `PreferConstructorOverTestInitializeFixer.cs` where `.FirstOrDefault()` was used to find an existing constructor, which would return the first constructor regardless of whether it was static or instance.

## Solution
Filter the constructor search to only consider instance constructors by excluding those with the `static` modifier:

```csharp
// Before (broken)
.FirstOrDefault();

// After (fixed)
.FirstOrDefault(c => !c.Modifiers.Any(SyntaxKind.StaticKeyword));
```

Now the codefix correctly creates a new instance constructor when only a static constructor exists, ensuring instance variables are properly initialized in the correct context.

## Testing
Added test case `WhenTestClassHasStaticCtorAndTestInitialize_Diagnostic` that reproduces the exact issue scenario and verifies the fix creates an instance constructor instead of modifying the static constructor.

Fixes #5934.

3085398469,15856,Add databricks-agents>=1.0.0rc2 as dependency of mlflow[databricks] extra,"This PR adds `databricks-agents>=1.0` as a dependency to the `mlflow[databricks]` optional extra to ensure that users who install MLflow with the databricks extras can use the functionality in the `mlflow.genai` module without additional installation steps.

Several functions in the `mlflow.genai` module (particularly in the `mlflow.genai.datasets` and `mlflow.genai.labeling` submodules) depend on the `databricks-agents` package. Currently, users need to manually install this package, but with this change, it will be included when a user installs MLflow with `pip install mlflow[databricks]`.

Changes made:
1. Updated `dev/pyproject.py` to include `databricks-agents>=1.0` in the `databricks` extra dependencies
2. Regenerated the following files:
   - `pyproject.toml` (used during development)
   - `pyproject.release.toml` (used when releasing)
   - `skinny/pyproject.toml`

Fixes #15855.

3116225832,16053,Fix type hint in log_feedback error parameter to accept Exception instead of Expectation,"The `log_feedback` function had an incorrect type hint for its `error` parameter that was inconsistent with the underlying `Feedback` class constructor.

**Issue:**
- `log_feedback` declared: `error: Optional[Union[Expectation, AssessmentError]]`
- `Feedback.__init__` expects: `error: Optional[Union[Exception, AssessmentError]]`

This created a type inconsistency where the function signature claimed to accept `Expectation` objects, but the actual implementation only handles `Exception` and `AssessmentError` objects.

**Changes:**
1. Fixed the type hint in `log_feedback` to match `Feedback.__init__`: `Optional[Union[Exception, AssessmentError]]`
2. Updated the documentation comment to reference `AssessmentError` instead of `Expectation` object
3. Added test `test_log_feedback_with_exception_object` to verify that `Exception` objects are properly handled

**Example usage that now has correct typing:**
```python
import mlflow
from mlflow.entities import AssessmentError

# Exception objects work correctly
try:
    raise ValueError(""LLM timeout"")
except ValueError as e:
    mlflow.log_feedback(trace_id=""123"", error=e)

# AssessmentError objects also work
error = AssessmentError(error_code=""TIMEOUT"", error_message=""Request timed out"")
mlflow.log_feedback(trace_id=""123"", error=error)
```

The fix ensures type consistency between the public API and the underlying implementation without changing any functionality.

Fixes #16052.

3168487570,9992,Add CLI version update notifications to Aspire CLI,"## Summary

Implements automatic update notifications for the Aspire CLI that notify users when newer versions are available on NuGet, following the specified notification rules for stable and prerelease versions.

## Changes

### Core Implementation
- **Extended `INuGetPackageCache`** with `GetCliPackagesAsync()` method to query Aspire.Cli packages with 1-hour cache expiration
- **Enhanced `NuGetPackagePrefetcher`** to prefetch CLI versions in background alongside existing template prefetch
- **Created `CliUpdateNotificationService`** that implements version comparison logic and displays update notifications
- **Integrated into `Program.Main`** to check for updates after successful command execution

### Notification Rules
The implementation follows the exact rules specified in the issue:

1. **Prerelease → Stable**: If using a prerelease version lower than the latest stable version, prompt to upgrade to stable
2. **Prerelease → Prerelease**: If using a prerelease version and a newer prerelease is available, prompt to upgrade  
3. **Stable → Stable**: If using a stable version and a newer stable version is available, prompt to upgrade

### Example Output
```
A new version of the Aspire CLI is available: 9.0.0
Update using: dotnet tool update --global Aspire.Cli
For more information, see: https://aka.ms/aspire/update-cli
```

### Key Features
- **Background Processing**: Version checks happen during CLI startup for better performance
- **Smart Caching**: 1-hour cache expiration for CLI updates vs longer cache for templates
- **Graceful Error Handling**: Update check failures don't impact main CLI functionality
- **Help Command Skip**: Prevents notification spam on help/version commands
- **Semantic Versioning**: Uses existing `SemVersion.PrecedenceComparer` for proper version comparison

### Files Changed
- `src/Aspire.Cli/NuGet/NuGetPackageCache.cs` - Added CLI package query method
- `src/Aspire.Cli/NuGet/NuGetPackagePrefetcher.cs` - Extended to prefetch CLI versions
- `src/Aspire.Cli/Utils/CliUpdateNotificationService.cs` - New service for update logic
- `src/Aspire.Cli/Program.cs` - Integration into main CLI flow
- `tests/Aspire.Cli.Tests/Utils/CliUpdateNotificationServiceTests.cs` - Unit tests

## Testing

Added unit tests that verify:
- Service handles newer versions correctly
- Service handles empty package lists gracefully  
- Version comparison logic follows the specified rules
- Integration with existing test infrastructure

## Implementation Notes

- Reuses existing NuGet infrastructure (prefetcher, cache, CLI runner) as suggested in the issue
- Follows repository patterns for dependency injection, error handling, and background services
- Minimal changes - extends existing functionality rather than replacing it
- No breaking changes to existing CLI behavior

The feature is now ready for users to receive automatic notifications about available CLI updates during normal usage.

3168670762,9995,Add extension methods to PublishingStep & PublishingTask for direct Complete/Update operations,"This PR adds extension methods to `PublishingStep` and `PublishingTask` that allow users to directly perform completion and update operations without needing to manually interact with the `IPublishingActivityProgressReporter`.

## Changes Made

### New Extension Methods
Added `PublishingExtensions` class with the following methods:

**For PublishingStep:**
- `UpdateStatusAsync(string statusText)` - Updates the step's status text
- `SucceedAsync(string? message)` - Completes the step successfully
- `WarnAsync(string? message)` - Completes the step with a warning
- `FailAsync(string? errorMessage)` - Completes the step with an error

**For PublishingTask:**
- `UpdateStatusAsync(string statusText)` - Updates the task's status text
- `SucceedAsync(string? message)` - Completes the task successfully
- `WarnAsync(string? message)` - Completes the task with a warning
- `FailAsync(string? errorMessage)` - Completes the task with an error

### Infrastructure Changes
- Added internal `Reporter` property to both `PublishingStep` and `PublishingTask` to store reference to the creating progress reporter
- Added `StatusText` property to `PublishingStep` to support status updates
- Extended `IPublishingActivityProgressReporter` with `UpdateStepAsync` method
- Updated both `PublishingActivityProgressReporter` and `NullPublishingActivityProgressReporter` to set reporter references and implement the new interface method

## Usage Example

```csharp
// Before: Manual reporter interaction
var step = await reporter.CreateStepAsync(""Building images"", cancellationToken);
await reporter.UpdateStepAsync(step, ""Processing..."", cancellationToken);
await reporter.CompleteStepAsync(step, ""Build completed"", cancellationToken);

// After: Direct extension methods
var step = await reporter.CreateStepAsync(""Building images"", cancellationToken);
await step.UpdateStatusAsync(""Processing..."", cancellationToken);
await step.SucceedAsync(""Build completed"", cancellationToken);
```

All existing tests continue to pass, and comprehensive tests have been added for the new extension methods.

Fixes #9994.

The change adds the following constraint to `requirements/constraints.txt`:

3223289542,10334,Fix missing 'name' property in TableService Bicep generation,"When using `AddTableService()` on Azure Storage, the generated Bicep was missing the required `name` property, resulting in invalid Bicep that fails validation.

**Problem:**
```csharp
var storage = builder.AddAzureStorage(""storage"");
var table = storage.AddTableService();
```

Generated invalid Bicep:

resource storage_tables 'Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/tableServices@2024-01-01' = {

```

**Root cause:**
The `AzureTableStorageResource.ToProvisioningEntity()` method creates a `TableService` instance but doesn't set the `Name` property. Unlike BlobService and QueueService which correctly generate `name: 'default'`, TableService was missing this required property.

**Solution:**
Reverted to previous behavior where we don't add a testServices resource to the bicep since we don't have table children (yet).

3115145732,5691,Rename RegisterTestFramework adapterFactory parameter to frameworkFactory,"This PR renames the `adapterFactory` parameter to `frameworkFactory` in the `Microsoft.Testing.Platform.Builder.ITestApplicationBuilder.RegisterTestFramework` public API.

## Changes Made

- Renamed `adapterFactory` parameter to `frameworkFactory` in `ITestApplicationBuilder.RegisterTestFramework` method signature
- Updated XML documentation for the parameter to reflect the new name
- Updated the implementation in `TestApplicationBuilder.cs` to use the new parameter name
- Updated parameter validation and assignment to use the new name

## Breaking Change Impact

This is a **code-breaking change** for calls that use the parameter name explicitly (e.g., `frameworkFactory: value`). However, it is **not a binary-breaking change** - all existing code using positional parameters will continue to work without recompilation.

Based on the analysis, major test frameworks (TUnit, NUnit, xUnit.net) do not use named parameters for this method, so the impact is minimal.

## Rationale

The previous naming `adapterFactory` was leaking implementation details from MSTest's VSTest compatible implementation and did not fit the generic interface semantics. The new name `frameworkFactory` better represents the purpose of this parameter in the generic testing platform context.

Fixes #2443.

3235990796,10456,Revert peer matching logic to fix database resource resolution regression,"## Problem

A regression was introduced in PR #10411 where database calls to uninstrumented peers no longer match their corresponding database resources in the Aspire Dashboard. This caused database connections to appear unmatched (with red error icons) instead of being properly linked to their database resources.

The issue occurred because the peer matching logic was changed from ""first one wins"" to ""return false if multiple resources match the same address."" While this was intended to handle ambiguous cases, it caused legitimate database connections to fail matching when multiple resources shared similar addresses.

## Examples

**Before (working):**
![Working database matching](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c92eb90d-f322-42d4-9d58-2afa8298d4df)

**After PR #10411 (broken):**
![Broken database matching](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d0449cb1-7a08-4efa-94a9-155c1c57e531)

The red database icon shows the call to `localhost:52074` no longer matches the postgres database resource.

## Solution

This PR reverts the `TryMatchAgainstResources` method back to the original ""first one wins"" logic as requested by @davidfowl for the 9.4 release:

1. **Restored immediate return on first match**: The method now returns `true` immediately when a matching resource is found, instead of checking for multiple matches
2. **Removed problematic tests**: Eliminated the 5 test methods that validated the ""multiple matches return false"" behavior that caused the regression
3. **Updated existing tests**: Modified tests to expect the restored ""first one wins"" behavior

## Code Changes

```csharp
// Before (problematic logic)
if (DoesAddressMatch(resourceAddress, peerAddress))
{
    if (foundResource is null)
    {
        foundResource = resource;
    }
    else if (!string.Equals(foundResource.Name, resource.Name, StringComparisons.ResourceName))
    {
        // Multiple different resources match - return false immediately
        name = null;
        resourceMatch = null;
        return false;
    }
    // ...
}

// After (restored logic)
if (DoesAddressMatch(resourceAddress, peerAddress))
{
    name = ResourceViewModel.GetResourceName(resource, resources);
    resourceMatch = resource;
    return true; // First one wins
}
```

## Impact

- Database calls to uninstrumented peers (like `localhost:52074`) now correctly match database resources
- Replica matching issues mentioned in the issue comments are also resolved
- The Dashboard properly displays database connections with the correct resource icons

This follows @davidfowl's guidance to revert PR #10411 changes for 9.4, allowing the team to design a more sophisticated approach for handling ambiguous matches in future releases.

Fixes #10452.

## Problem

The `_is_abstract_method` function in `dev/clint/src/clint/rules.py` was using simple pattern matching to detect abstract method decorators, only checking for:
- Direct usage: `@abstractmethod`
- Module-qualified usage: `@abc.abstractmethod`

This approach missed cases where `abstractmethod` is imported with an alias or through different import patterns, causing the `InvalidAbstractMethod` rule to miss violations.

## Example

Before this fix, the linter would miss violations like:

```python
from abc import abstractmethod as am
import abc as abstract_base_classes

class Example:
    @am  # This violation was NOT detected
    def method1(self):
        print(""Invalid abstract method body"")
    
    @abstract_base_classes.abstractmethod  # This violation was NOT detected
    def method2(self):
        return ""Invalid abstract method body""
```

## Solution

This PR improves the accuracy by using the existing `Resolver` to detect abstract methods regardless of how they're imported:

1. **Moved** `_is_abstract_method` to be a static method of `InvalidAbstractMethod` class
2. **Modified** it to accept a `Resolver` parameter and use resolver-based detection
3. **Added** `_has_invalid_body` static method to better organize the body validation logic
4. **Updated** `InvalidAbstractMethod.check` to use the resolver
5. **Updated** the linter to pass the resolver to the check method

## Changes

- **`dev/clint/src/clint/rules.py`**: Removed standalone `_is_abstract_method` function and added resolver-based static methods to `InvalidAbstractMethod` class
- **`dev/clint/src/clint/linter.py`**: Updated `_invalid_abstract_method` to pass resolver to the check method

## Validation

After the fix, the linter now correctly detects violations for all import patterns:

```python
from abc import abstractmethod as am
import abc as abstract_base_classes

class Example:
    @am  # ✅ Now detected as violation
    def method1(self):
        print(""Invalid abstract method body"")
    
    @abstract_base_classes.abstractmethod  # ✅ Now detected as violation  
    def method2(self):
        return ""Invalid abstract method body""
    
    @am  # ✅ Valid usage still works
    def method3(self):
        pass
```

The changes are minimal and surgical, preserving all existing functionality while extending detection to handle aliased imports through the resolver.

Fixes #16368.

3255139387,10624,Fix GitHubModels health check dependency on IHttpClientFactory,"The GitHubModels health check was failing when `IHttpClientFactory` was not explicitly registered by the user, causing the following exception:

```
System.InvalidOperationException: No service for type 'System.Net.Http.IHttpClientFactory' has been registered.
   at Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.ServiceProviderServiceExtensions.GetRequiredService(IServiceProvider provider, Type serviceType)
   at Aspire.Hosting.GitHubModelsExtensions.<>c__DisplayClass2_0.<WithHealthCheck>b__0(IServiceProvider sp)
```

## Root Cause
The `WithHealthCheck` method in `GitHubModelsExtensions.cs` was calling `sp.GetRequiredService<IHttpClientFactory>()` without ensuring that the HTTP client services were registered first.

## Solution
Modified the `WithHealthCheck` method to automatically call `builder.ApplicationBuilder.Services.AddHttpClient()` before registering the health check. This ensures that:

1. **Users don't need to manually register `AddHttpClient()`** - The API follows the principle of least surprise
2. **Backward compatibility** - If users have already called `AddHttpClient()`, calling it again is safe
3. **Proper dependency management** - The health check automatically ensures its dependencies are available

## Changes Made
- Added automatic `AddHttpClient()` registration in the `WithHealthCheck` method
- Added comprehensive tests to verify the fix works in both scenarios:
  - When no manual `AddHttpClient()` call is made
  - When `AddHttpClient()` is called manually before `WithHealthCheck()`

## Testing
```csharp
// This now works without manual AddHttpClient() registration
var github = builder.AddGitHubModel(""github"", ""openai/gpt-4o-mini"").WithHealthCheck();

// This also continues to work (backward compatible)
builder.Services.AddHttpClient();
var github = builder.AddGitHubModel(""github"", ""openai/gpt-4o-mini"").WithHealthCheck();

3208736303,5944,Fix MSTEST0020 codefix constructor added in place of the TestInitialize method,"The MSTEST0020 codefix (PreferConstructorOverTestInitialize) was placing newly created constructors at the end of the class instead of following C# coding conventions.

## Problem
When applying the codefix to convert a `[TestInitialize]` method to a constructor in a class that doesn't already have a constructor, the new constructor was added at the end of the class:

```csharp
// Before codefix
[TestClass]
public sealed class Test1
{
    private object _instanceVariable;

    [TestInitialize]
    public void Initialize()
    {
        _instanceVariable = new object();
    }

    [TestMethod]
    public void TestMethod1() { }

    private void SomePrivateMethod() { }
}

// After codefix (OLD - incorrect placement)
[TestClass]
public sealed class Test1
{
    private object _instanceVariable;

    [TestMethod]
    public void TestMethod1() { }

    private void SomePrivateMethod() { }

    public Test1()  // ❌ Constructor at end of class
    {
        _instanceVariable = new object();
    }
}
```

## Solution
Updated the codefix to place constructors at the appropriate position following C# conventions: after fields and static constructors, but before properties and methods.

```csharp
// After codefix (NEW - correct placement)
[TestClass]
public sealed class Test1
{
    private object _instanceVariable;

    public Test1()  // ✅ Constructor after field, before methods
    {
        _instanceVariable = new object();
    }

    [TestMethod]
    public void TestMethod1() { }

    private void SomePrivateMethod() { }
}
```

## Implementation
- Replaced `editor.AddMember()` with smart positioning logic
- Finds the last field or static constructor in the class
- Uses `editor.InsertAfter()` to place the constructor at the appropriate location
- Falls back to placing at the TestInitialize method position if no fields/static constructors exist
- Preserves existing behavior for classes that already have constructors

## Test Coverage
- Added test case for the reported scenario (fields + TestInitialize + methods)
- Verified compatibility with all existing test cases
- Confirmed proper placement after static constructors

Fixes #5938.

## Changes Made

- **Moved files**: 
  - `src/Aspire.Hosting/ApplicationModel/IInteractionService.cs` → `src/Aspire.Hosting/IInteractionService.cs`
  - `src/Aspire.Hosting/ApplicationModel/InteractionService.cs` → `src/Aspire.Hosting/InteractionService.cs`

- **Updated namespace declarations**: Changed from `namespace Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel` to `namespace Aspire.Hosting` in both files

- **Fixed namespace conflicts**: Updated `DashboardService.cs` to use fully qualified names to disambiguate between the hosting types and Proto types (e.g., `Aspire.Hosting.MessageIntent` vs `Aspire.DashboardService.Proto.V1.MessageIntent`)

- **Removed unnecessary using statements**: Cleaned up files that no longer need `using Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel` since the types are now in the same namespace

- **Updated test references**: Fixed test code to reference the types in their new namespace location

## Types Moved

The following types are now in the `Aspire.Hosting` namespace:
- `IInteractionService`
- `InteractionService` 
- `InteractionInput`
- `InputType`
- `MessageIntent`
- `InteractionResult<T>`
- `InputsDialogInteractionOptions`
- `MessageBoxInteractionOptions`
- `MessageBarInteractionOptions`
- `InteractionOptions`
- `InputsDialogValidationContext`

All builds and tests pass successfully after the migration.

Fixes #10266.

## Changes Made

### Package References Removed
- `Aspire.Elastic.Clients.Elasticsearch` from `tests/Shared/RepoTesting/Directory.Packages.Helix.props`
- `Aspire.Hosting.Elasticsearch` from `tests/Shared/RepoTesting/Directory.Packages.Helix.props`
- `Testcontainers.Elasticsearch` from `tests/Directory.Packages.props`
- `Elastic.Clients.Elasticsearch` from root `Directory.Packages.props`

### Code Updates
- Removed `ElasticsearchResource` from `src/Shared/Model/KnownResourceTypes.cs`
- Updated test methods in `tests/Aspire.Hosting.Tests/ResourceExtensionsTests.cs` to use nginx containers instead of elasticsearch while maintaining the same test logic and coverage
- Updated documentation examples in `src/Aspire.Hosting/ApplicationModel/ResourceExtensions.cs` to use nginx instead of elasticsearch

## Testing
- All builds pass successfully
- Test methods maintain the same functionality with nginx containers instead of elasticsearch
- No functional changes to the API or behavior, only removal of obsolete references

The changes are minimal and surgical, focusing only on removing the leftover ElasticSearch references while preserving all existing functionality.

Fixes #9109.

3238835611,10496,Add user-friendly error handling for `aspire new` when directory contains existing files,"## Summary

Fixes #9685 by replacing the long, unfriendly error output from `dotnet new` with a clear, actionable message when users attempt to create a new Aspire project in a directory that already contains files.

## Problem

When running `aspire new` in a directory that already contains files from a previous project, the command would fail with exit code 73 and display a long, technical error message from `dotnet new` that mentioned the unsupported `--force` option. This was confusing for users since the aspire CLI doesn't support the `--force` flag.

**Before:**
```
Creating this template will make changes to existing files:
  Overwrite   Program.cs

To create the template anyway, run the command with '--force' option:
   dotnet new console --name TestConsole2 --output . --force

For details on the exit code, refer to https://aka.ms/templating-exit-codes#73
```

## Solution

Added custom error handling that detects exit code 73 from `dotnet new` and displays a user-friendly message instead.

**After:**
```
The output folder already contains files from a previous project. Please remove or move these files before creating a new project in this location.
```

## Changes Made

### Core Implementation
- **Added `ProjectAlreadyExistsException`**: New custom exception in `Aspire.Cli.Exceptions` namespace
- **Enhanced `DotNetCliRunner.NewProjectAsync`**: Modified to detect exit code 73 from `dotnet new` and throw the custom exception with reference to issue #9685
- **Enhanced `DotNetTemplateFactory.ApplyTemplateAsync`**: Added try-catch block to handle `ProjectAlreadyExistsException` and display the user-friendly error message

### Resources
- **Added resource string**: New `ProjectAlreadyExists` string in `TemplatingStrings.resx` with the user-friendly message
- **Updated Designer.cs**: Added corresponding property for the new resource string

### Testing
- **Added end-to-end test**: `NewCommandWithExitCode73ShowsUserFriendlyError` verifies the complete flow returns the correct exit code
- **Added unit test**: `NewProjectAsyncThrowsProjectAlreadyExistsExceptionOnExitCode73` verifies `DotNetCliRunner` throws the correct exception on exit code 73
- **All 112 CLI tests pass**: No regressions introduced

## Technical Details

The implementation is surgical and minimal:

1. **Detection**: `DotNetCliRunner.NewProjectAsync` checks if `dotnet new` returns exit code 73
2. **Exception**: Throws `ProjectAlreadyExistsException` instead of returning the exit code
3. **Handling**: `DotNetTemplateFactory.ApplyTemplateAsync` catches the exception and displays the friendly message
4. **Fallback**: All other exit codes continue to work exactly as before

## Verification

✅ **Functionality verified**: Confirmed `dotnet new` returns exit code 73 when attempting to create templates in directories with existing files  
✅ **No regressions**: All existing CLI functionality preserved  
✅ **Error handling**: Custom exception properly thrown and caught  
✅ **User experience**: Clear, actionable error message displayed  

The change provides users with clear guidance on how to resolve the issue (remove or move existing files) without mentioning unsupported options.

*This pull request was created as a result of the following prompt from Copilot chat.*
> Currently, when running 'aspire new' in a directory that already contains files from a previous project, the command fails because 'dotnet new' returns exit code 73. The error output shown to users is long and includes a mention of the unsupported '--force' option. We want to improve this by detecting exit code 73 and instead displaying a user-friendly error that does not mention '--force'. The message should advise users to remove or move existing files before creating a new project.
> 
> Requirements:
> - In the code that executes 'dotnet new' (via IDotNetCliRunner in NewCommand or related templating logic), detect if the exit code is 73.
> - If exit code 73 is detected, throw a custom exception (e.g., ProjectAlreadyExistsException).
> - Catch this exception where user-facing messages are rendered, and show:
>   ""The output folder already contains files from a previous project. Please remove or move these files before creating a new project in this location.""
> - Do not mention '--force' in the error message, since it's not supported by the aspire CLI.
> - Reference issue #9685 in the PR.
> 
> Context:
> - This is to replace the long, unfriendly error output from 'dotnet new' when duplicate project creation is attempted.
> - The goal is to provide clearer, actionable guidance to users.

3164627288,9979,Add isError parameter to CompleteStepAsync method in PublishingActivityProgressReporter,"The `PublishingActivityProgressReporter.CompleteStepAsync` method now supports completing steps with error state through a new optional `isError` parameter. This brings the step completion API in line with the existing task completion functionality.

## Changes Made

### Interface Updates
```csharp
// Before
Task CompleteStepAsync(PublishingStep step, string completionText, CancellationToken cancellationToken);

// After  
Task CompleteStepAsync(PublishingStep step, string completionText, bool isError = false, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);
```

### Key Features
- **Backward Compatible**: The `isError` parameter defaults to `false`, ensuring all existing code continues to work without modification
- **Consistent API**: Follows the same pattern as the existing `CompleteTaskAsync` method which already supports error states
- **Proper Error Propagation**: The error state is correctly passed to `PublishingActivityData.IsError` and submitted over RPC
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Added parameterized tests covering both success and error completion scenarios

### Files Modified
- `src/Aspire.Hosting/Publishing/PublishingActivityProgressReporter.cs` - Added `isError` parameter to interface and implementation
- `src/Aspire.Hosting/Publishing/NullPublishingActivityProgressReporter.cs` - Updated null implementation to match interface
- `src/Aspire.Hosting/Publishing/ResourceContainerImageBuilder.cs` - Updated method call to use named parameter syntax
- `tests/Aspire.Hosting.Tests/Publishing/PublishingActivityProgressReporterTests.cs` - Enhanced test coverage with Theory tests

### Example Usage
```csharp
// Complete step successfully (default behavior)
await reporter.CompleteStepAsync(step, ""Step completed successfully"");

// Complete step with error
await reporter.CompleteStepAsync(step, ""Step failed with errors"", isError: true);
```

The implementation maintains full backward compatibility while enabling publishers to properly report step completion status, allowing the publishing activity system to accurately track both successful and failed step completions.

Fixes #9978.

3076114345,5600,Fix MSTEST0004 analyzer to recognize TestClass-derived attributes,"The MSTEST0004 analyzer currently doesn't recognize test classes that are marked with attributes derived from `TestClassAttribute`, such as `STATestClassAttribute` or custom `TestClass`-derived attributes.

This PR fixes the issue by changing the attribute check in `PublicTypeShouldBeTestClassAnalyzer` to use the `Inherits` method instead of direct equality comparison, which aligns it with how other analyzers in the codebase (like `TestClassShouldHaveTestMethodAnalyzer`) check for derived attributes.

### Reproduction

```csharp
// Using STATestClassAttribute
[STATestClass]
public class FooTests
{
    // Test methods
}

// Using a custom derived attribute
public sealed class MyTestClassAttribute : TestClassAttribute;

[MyTestClass]
public class FooTests
{
    // Test methods
}
```

**Before:** The analyzer would incorrectly report ""Public type 'FooTests' should be marked with '[TestClass]' or changed to 'internal'""

**After:** The analyzer correctly recognizes that the class is already marked with a `TestClass`-derived attribute and doesn't report any issues.

Fixes #5594.

3076267770,5601,Fix MSTEST0005 false positive when using null-checking with TestContext constructor parameter,"## Issue
When using a null check with the `TestContext` constructor parameter (such as with the null-coalescing operator `??`), the analyzer incorrectly reports the MSTEST0005 warning, even though the `TestContext` is properly assigned in the constructor.

```csharp
[TestClass]
public class MyTestClassTestContextThroughCtor
{
    private readonly TestContext _testContext;

    public MyTestClassTestContextThroughCtor(TestContext testContext)
    {
        // This triggers MSTEST0005 incorrectly
        _testContext = testContext ?? throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(testContext));
    }

    public TestContext TestContext => _testContext;
}
```

## Fix
Modified the analyzer to properly detect field and property assignments that use the null-coalescing operator (`??`) when assigning the `TestContext` parameter from the constructor. This ensures that common null-checking patterns don't trigger false warnings.

The changes include:
- Updated `CollectTestContextFieldsAssignedInConstructor` method to recognize assignments using the null-coalescing operator
- Updated `AssignsParameterToMember` method to handle property assignments with null checks
- Added comprehensive test cases to verify the fix works for various null-checking patterns

Fixes #5583.

3104442713,9597,Add dashboard resource to AddDockerComposeEnvironment,"This PR adds support for automatically including an Aspire dashboard when using Docker Compose environments, enabling telemetry visualization for containerized applications.

## Changes

### 1. New `OtlpExporterAnnotation`
- Added a new annotation to mark resources that have OTLP exporter configured
- Allows automatic detection of resources that should send telemetry to the dashboard

### 2. Enhanced `WithOtlpExporter`
- Updated to add the `OtlpExporterAnnotation` when called
- Enables automatic identification of resources with telemetry configured

### 3. New `WithDashboard` method
- Added `WithDashboard(bool enabled = true)` extension method for Docker Compose environments
- Only adds dashboard in publish mode to avoid conflicts during development
- Automatically configures OTLP endpoints for all resources with the annotation

### 4. Automatic OTLP Configuration
- When dashboard is enabled, automatically configures all annotated resources to send telemetry to the dashboard
- Sets appropriate environment variables (`OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`, `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL`, `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME`)
- Skips configuring the dashboard container itself to prevent circular references

## Usage Example

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var composeEnv = builder.AddDockerComposeEnvironment(""docker-compose"")
    .WithDashboard(); // Enables dashboard with telemetry

// Resources with OTLP will automatically send telemetry to dashboard
builder.AddContainer(""api"", ""my-api"")
    .WithOtlpExporter();

builder.AddContainer(""worker"", ""my-worker"")
    .WithOtlpExporter();
```

## Implementation Details

- The dashboard container uses `mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/nightly/aspire-dashboard` image
- Exposes port 18888 for the dashboard UI and port 18889 for OTLP ingestion
- Configured with `restart: always` for reliability
- Uses event subscription to configure OTLP after all resources are created

## Tests

Added comprehensive test coverage including:
- Dashboard creation in publish mode
- OTLP annotation detection and configuration
- Dashboard disabled functionality
- Run mode behavior (no dashboard creation)

Fixes #9596.

3104480641,9600,Add WithDashboard() method to allow opting out of Aspire dashboard in Azure Container App environments,"This PR adds the ability for users to disable the Aspire dashboard in Azure Container App environments through a new `WithDashboard(bool enable = true)` extension method.

## Problem

Previously, the Aspire dashboard was always added to Azure Container App environments with no way to opt out. This created unnecessary resources for users who didn't want the dashboard functionality.

## Solution

Added a new `WithDashboard(bool enable = true)` extension method that allows users to control dashboard inclusion:

```csharp
// Default behavior (dashboard enabled) - unchanged for backward compatibility
builder.AddAzureContainerAppEnvironment(""env"");

// Explicitly enable dashboard
builder.AddAzureContainerAppEnvironment(""env"").WithDashboard(true);

// Disable dashboard (new functionality)
builder.AddAzureContainerAppEnvironment(""env"").WithDashboard(false);
```

## Implementation Details

1. **Added `EnableDashboard` property** to `AzureContainerAppEnvironmentResource` (defaults to `true`)
2. **Added `WithDashboard(bool enable = true)` extension method** for fluent configuration
3. **Modified infrastructure creation logic** to conditionally add the dashboard resource based on the `EnableDashboard` property
4. **Updated API surface** to include the new extension method
5. **Added tests** to verify both enabled and disabled scenarios

The dashboard resource creation is now wrapped in a conditional check:

```csharp
if (appEnvResource.EnableDashboard)
{
    var dashboard = new ContainerAppEnvironmentDotnetComponentResource(""aspireDashboard"", ""2024-10-02-preview"")
    {
        Name = ""aspire-dashboard"",
        ComponentType = ""AspireDashboard"",
        Parent = containerAppEnvironment
    };
    infra.Add(dashboard);
}
```

## Backward Compatibility

The default behavior remains unchanged - the dashboard is enabled by default, ensuring existing code continues to work without modification.

Fixes #9599.

### 1. Enabled RUF002 Rule
- Added `RUF002` to the enabled rules list in `pyproject.toml`

### 2. Fixed Ambiguous Unicode Characters
Fixed 18 instances of ambiguous unicode characters across 11 files:

**Left/Right Single Quotation Marks (`'` and `'`) → Standard Apostrophe (`'`)**
- `mlflow/models/python_api.py`: Fixed quotes in `{'json', 'csv'}` dictionary
- `mlflow/pytorch/__init__.py`: Fixed ""model's weights"" 
- `mlflow/pytorch/_lightning_autolog.py`: Fixed ""model's weights""
- `mlflow/sklearn/__init__.py`: Fixed ""scorer's rank_test_score""
- `mlflow/sklearn/utils.py`: Fixed ""don't even define""
- `mlflow/tensorflow/__init__.py`: Fixed ""model's weights""
- `mlflow/tensorflow/callback.py`: Fixed ""model's weights""
- `mlflow/utils/checkpoint_utils.py`: Fixed ""model's weights""

**No-Break Spaces (`\u00a0`) → Regular Spaces (` `)**
- `mlflow/pyfunc/__init__.py`: Fixed spacing in ASCII tree structure

**Ambiguous Hyphens (`‐` and `‑`) → Standard Hyphen-Minus (`-`)**
- `mlflow/tracking/client.py`: Fixed ""registry‐search"" → ""registry-search""
- `tests/langgraph/sample_code/langgraph_with_autolog.py`: Fixed ""Side‑effect"" and ""state‑field""

## Verification

- ✅ `ruff check --select RUF002 .` passes with no violations
- ✅ All existing ruff checks continue to pass
- ✅ RUF002 rule correctly catches new violations when tested

The rule will now prevent future introduction of ambiguous unicode characters in docstrings, improving code consistency and readability.

Fixes #16471.

The test has been identified as flaky and failing non-deterministically. By adding the quarantine attribute, the test will:
- Be excluded from regular CI test runs to prevent false negatives
- Continue to run in the outerloop workflow for monitoring
- Allow the team to investigate and fix the underlying issue without blocking PRs

**Changes made:**
- Added `[QuarantinedTest(""https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/issues/10086"")]` attribute to the `StartResourceForcesStart` test method
- Follows the established pattern used by other quarantined tests in the repository

The change is minimal and surgical, affecting only the specific test that needs to be quarantined while maintaining the existing test structure and functionality.

Fixes #10088.

3092400652,15889,Remove 'submodules: recursive' from GitHub Actions workflows,"## Summary
This PR removes the `submodules: recursive` parameter from all GitHub Actions workflow files. This parameter was necessary when the repository contained Git submodules, but it is no longer needed since the submodules have been removed.

## Changes
- Removed `submodules: recursive` line from all workflow files in `.github/workflows/`
- Cleaned up empty `with:` sections where `submodules: recursive` was the only parameter
- Preserved other parameters under `with:` sections where they existed

## Impact
These changes are minimal and focused on removing only the unnecessary parameter while maintaining the overall structure of the workflows. This should slightly improve workflow efficiency by avoiding unnecessary submodule operations during checkout.

Fixes #15888.

3269654002,6200,Add timeout tests for GlobalTestInitializeAttribute and GlobalTestCleanupAttribute,"This PR adds comprehensive timeout test coverage for the new `GlobalTestInitializeAttribute` and `GlobalTestCleanupAttribute` introduced in PR #6132.

## Changes Made

### Test Coverage Added
- **8 new timeout test methods** covering basic timeout scenarios:
  - Test context cancellation for global test initialize
  - Hard timeout expiration for global test initialize/cleanup
  - Timeout with cancellation token usage
  - RunSettings-based timeout configuration
  - Attribute precedence over RunSettings

- **4 new cooperative cancellation test methods** covering:
  - Cooperative timeout behavior for global test initialize/cleanup
  - Token checking scenarios with cooperative cancellation

### Test Infrastructure Updates
- Updated `InfoByKind` dictionary to include mappings for global test methods
- Enhanced test assets (`SourceCode` and `CooperativeTimeoutSourceCode`) to include:
  - `GlobalTestInit` method with proper timeout handling
  - `GlobalTestCleanupMethod` with timeout support
  - Environment variable-based test scenario control

### Test Patterns
All new tests follow the exact same patterns as existing timeout tests:
- Same naming conventions (`GlobalTestInit_WhenTimeoutExpires_...`)
- Same parameter patterns using `DynamicData` for target frameworks
- Same assertion patterns using helper methods like `RunAndAssertTestTimedOutAsync`
- Same test asset structure with configurable timeout behaviors

The implementation ensures that global test attributes have the same level of timeout test coverage as other test fixture methods (AssemblyInitialize, ClassInitialize, TestInitialize, etc.).

Fixes #6198.

3185272057,10111,Add Value property to PublishingPromptInput to enable default value flow,"## Problem

`PublishingPromptInput` was missing a `Value` property, preventing default values from flowing from `InteractionInput.Value` to CLI prompts during publishing operations. This meant that prompts could not be pre-filled with intended defaults, reducing usability.

## Solution

Added complete end-to-end support for default values in publishing prompts:

### Core Changes

1. **Added `Value` property** to `PublishingPromptInput` in both `Aspire.Hosting` and `Aspire.Cli` projects:
   ```csharp
   /// <summary>
   /// Gets the default value for the input.
   /// </summary>
   public string? Value { get; init; }
   ```

2. **Enhanced data flow** in `PublishingActivityProgressReporter.cs` to capture and forward values:
   ```csharp
   var promptInputs = inputsInfo.Inputs.Select(input => new PublishingPromptInput
   {
       Label = input.Label,
       InputType = input.InputType.ToString(),
       Required = input.Required,
       Options = input.Options,
       Value = input.Value  // Now flows the default value
   }).ToList();
   ```

3. **Updated prompt handling** in `PublishCommandBase.cs` to use default values for all input types:
   - **Text/Secret/Number inputs**: `defaultValue: input.Value`
   - **Boolean inputs**: `defaultValue: ParseBooleanValue(input.Value)`
   - **Choice inputs**: Fallback with default value support

4. **Added helper method** for safe boolean parsing:
   ```csharp
   private static bool ParseBooleanValue(string? value)
   {
       return bool.TryParse(value, out var result) && result;
   }
   ```

### Testing

- Enhanced test infrastructure to support default value validation
- Added comprehensive test `PublishCommand_TextInputWithDefaultValue_UsesDefaultCorrectly`
- Verified complete flow: `InteractionInput.Value` → `PublishingPromptInput.Value` → CLI prompt defaults

### Test Results

- ✅ New default value functionality test passes
- ✅ All existing PublishCommand tests pass (14 total)
- ✅ All prompt-related tests pass (17 total)
- ✅ All CLI tests pass (91 total)
- ✅ All PublishingActivityProgressReporter tests pass (30 total)

## Impact

Users can now set default values in `InteractionInput.Value` that will automatically pre-fill CLI prompts during publishing operations, significantly improving user experience by reducing manual input requirements.

**Example usage:**
```csharp
var input = new InteractionInput
{
    Label = ""Environment Name"",
    InputType = InputType.Text,
    Required = true,
    Value = ""development""  // This will now pre-fill the CLI prompt
};
```

Fixes the missing default value flow for prompts during publishing as described in the original issue.

3150188181,5786,Add analyzer to suggest using cooperative cancellation for timeout,"This PR introduces a new analyzer `MSTEST0045` that warns users when they use `[Timeout]` attribute without explicitly setting `CooperativeCancellation = true`. This prepares users for a future breaking change where cooperative cancellation will become the default behavior.

## Problem

Currently, the `TimeoutAttribute` has a `CooperativeCancellation` property that defaults to `false`. In a future version (v5.0), cooperative cancellation will become the default behavior. To help users prepare for this breaking change, we need an analyzer that encourages them to explicitly opt into the recommended behavior.

## Solution

The new analyzer `UseCooperativeCancellationForTimeoutAnalyzer` detects:

- `[Timeout]` attributes on test methods without `CooperativeCancellation` specified
- `[Timeout]` attributes with `CooperativeCancellation = false` explicitly set

And reports an Info-level diagnostic suggesting to use `CooperativeCancellation = true`.

### Examples

**❌ Will trigger diagnostic:**
```csharp
[TestMethod]
[Timeout(5000)] // Missing CooperativeCancellation
public void MyTest() { }

[TestMethod]  
[Timeout(5000, CooperativeCancellation = false)] // Explicitly false
public void MyTest() { }
```

**✅ No diagnostic:**
```csharp
[TestMethod]
[Timeout(5000, CooperativeCancellation = true)] // Explicitly true - recommended
public void MyTest() { }
```

## Implementation Details

- **Analyzer ID**: `MSTEST0045`
- **Category**: Usage
- **Severity**: Info
- **Scope**: Only analyzes `[Timeout]` attributes on test methods (`[TestMethod]`, `[DataTestMethod]`, etc.)

## Files Added/Modified

- ✅ `UseCooperativeCancellationForTimeoutAnalyzer.cs` - Main analyzer implementation
- ✅ `UseCooperativeCancellationForTimeoutAnalyzerTests.cs` - Comprehensive unit tests
- ✅ Updated `WellKnownTypeNames.cs` to include `TimeoutAttribute`
- ✅ Updated `DiagnosticIds.cs` with `MSTEST0045`
- ✅ Updated resource files with localized diagnostic messages
- ✅ Updated public API and analyzer release documentation

## Test Coverage

The implementation includes comprehensive tests covering:
- Timeout without cooperative cancellation → diagnostic
- Timeout with `CooperativeCancellation = true` → no diagnostic
- Timeout with `CooperativeCancellation = false` → diagnostic  
- Timeout on non-test methods → no diagnostic
- Various test method types (`TestMethod`, `DataTestMethod`)
- `TestTimeout` enum usage scenarios

Fixes #5761.

3150327302,5790,"Add comparison Assert APIs (IsGreaterThan, IsLessThan, IsPositive, IsNegative)","This PR adds six new comparison Assert APIs to enhance testing capabilities:

- `IsGreaterThan<T>(T expected, T actual)`
- `IsGreaterThanOrEqualTo<T>(T expected, T actual)`
- `IsLessThan<T>(T expected, T actual)`
- `IsLessThanOrEqualTo<T>(T expected, T actual)`
- `IsPositive<T>(T actual)`
- `IsNegative<T>(T actual)`

## Key Features

- **Type Safety**: All methods use generic constraint `where T : struct, IComparable<T>`
- **Consistent API**: Each method has 3 overloads (basic, with message, with message + parameters)
- **Parameter Order**: Expected value comes before actual value for comparison methods
- **Special Handling**: `IsPositive` and `IsNegative` fail for zero and NaN values as required

## Implementation Details

- Added new file `Assert.IComparable.cs` containing all comparison methods
- Added corresponding error messages to `FrameworkMessages.resx`
- Included proper exception handling with descriptive error messages
- Follows existing codebase patterns and conventions

## Example Usage

```csharp
// Basic comparisons
Assert.IsGreaterThan(10, result);  // Assert that 10 > result
Assert.IsLessThan(result, 100);    // Assert that result < 100

// Positive/negative checks
Assert.IsPositive(temperature);    // Assert temperature > 0
Assert.IsNegative(offset);         // Assert offset < 0

// With custom messages
Assert.IsGreaterThanOrEqualTo(minValue, actual, ""Value must meet minimum threshold"");
```

## Testing

Comprehensive test suite added in `AssertTests.IComparableTests.cs` covering:
- Positive and negative test cases for all methods
- Edge cases (zero, NaN, equal values)
- Message formatting and parameter substitution
- Multiple numeric types (int, double, float)

Fixes #5789.

3124026492,9737,Simplify AzureProvisioner and make it testable by removing unnecessary abstraction layers,"This PR simplifies the AzureProvisioner by removing unnecessary abstraction layers that were built for multiple provisioners but only had one implementation (`BicepProvisioner`). The changes make the code more maintainable and testable while preserving all existing functionality.

## Changes Made

### Removed Unnecessary Abstractions
- **Deleted `IAzureResourceProvisioner` interface** - No longer needed since only one implementation existed
- **Deleted `AzureResourceProvisioner<T>` base class** - Unnecessary generic abstraction
- **Deleted `BicepProvisioner` class** - Integrated its functionality directly into `AzureProvisioner`
- **Removed provisioner selection logic** - The `SelectProvisioner` method that always returned `BicepProvisioner`
- **Removed `AddAzureProvisioner<TResource, TProvisioner>` extension method** - No longer needed

### Integrated BicepProvisioner into AzureProvisioner
- Moved all Bicep provisioning logic directly into `AzureProvisioner.ProcessResourceAsync`
- Integrated ARM template compilation, deployment, and resource configuration
- Preserved all existing functionality including checksum validation, parameter handling, and deployment URLs

### Added Internal Interfaces for Testability
Created clean abstractions for external dependencies:
- **`IArmClientProvider`** - Abstracts Azure ARM client creation
- **`ISecretClientProvider`** - Abstracts Key Vault secret client creation  
- **`IBicepCliExecutor`** - Abstracts bicep CLI execution
- **`IUserSecretsManager`** - Abstracts user secrets file operations
- **`IProvisioningContextProvider`** - Abstracts Azure provisioning context creation

### Preserved Test Compatibility
- **Created `BicepUtilities` class** - Contains shared static methods (`SetParametersAsync`, `GetChecksum`, etc.) for existing tests
- **Added comprehensive unit tests** - Validates new interfaces and structure
- **Maintained existing test APIs** - All existing `BicepProvisioner` tests continue to work

## Code Quality Improvements

**Before:**
```csharp
// Complex provisioner selection logic
var provisioner = SelectProvisioner(resource.AzureResource);
if (provisioner is null) {
    // Handle missing provisioner
} else {
    await provisioner.GetOrCreateResourceAsync(resource.AzureResource, context, cancellationToken);
}
```

**After:**
```csharp
// Direct handling since only Bicep resources are supported
if (resource.AzureResource is not AzureBicepResource bicepResource) {
    // Skip non-Bicep resources
    return;
}
await GetOrCreateResourceAsync(bicepResource, context, cancellationToken);
```

## Impact Summary
- **Reduced complexity** - Removed 3 unnecessary classes and 1 interface
- **Improved testability** - Added 5 internal interfaces with default implementations
- **Maintained compatibility** - All existing functionality preserved
- **Cleaner codebase** - 849 lines removed, 925 lines added (net +76 lines, mostly reorganization)

The abstractions were originally designed to support multiple provisioner types, but since only `BicepProvisioner` was ever implemented, this simplification removes the unnecessary complexity while making the code much more testable through dependency injection.

Fixes #8752.

- Renamed `test_differenet_requirements_create_different_environments` to `test_different_requirements_create_different_environments`
- Verified that no other references to this function exist in the codebase
- Confirmed test runs successfully (though it's skipped in CI due to environment dependencies, which is expected)

This is a simple typo fix that maintains the functionality of the test while improving code readability.

Fixes #15876.

3179451686,10067,Add ProgressReporter property to DeployingContext,"This PR adds a `ProgressReporter` property to the `DeployingContext` class to match the functionality already available in `PublishingContext`.

## Changes Made

### `src/Aspire.Hosting/Publishing/DeployingContext.cs`
- Added `ProgressReporter` property with lazy initialization using the service provider
- Added necessary using statements for `Aspire.Hosting.Publishing` and `Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection`
- Implementation follows the exact same pattern as `PublishingContext`:

```csharp
public IPublishingActivityProgressReporter ProgressReporter => _progressReporter ??=
    Services.GetRequiredService<IPublishingActivityProgressReporter>();
```

### `tests/Aspire.Hosting.Tests/PublishingTests.cs`
- Added `DeployingContextProgressReporterProperty()` test to verify the property works correctly
- Test validates that the property is accessible, returns the correct type, and uses lazy initialization

## Validation
- ✅ Code compiles successfully
- ✅ Implementation matches the exact pattern used in `PublishingContext`
- ✅ Added comprehensive test coverage
- ✅ Follows existing codebase conventions
- ✅ Minimal, surgical changes that don't affect existing functionality

This change enables consumers of `DeployingContext` to access progress reporting functionality during deployment operations, providing consistent API surface between publishing and deploying contexts.

Fixes #10066.

3106934710,9615,Add GetSecret convenience API and WithSecret methods for AzureKeyVaultResource,"This PR implements the missing convenience APIs for managing secrets in `AzureKeyVaultResource` as requested in the issue.

## Changes Made

### GetSecret Convenience API
Added a `GetSecret` extension method on `IResourceBuilder<AzureKeyVaultResource>` that delegates to the existing `IAzureKeyVaultResource.GetSecret` method:

```csharp
var kv = builder.AddAzureKeyVault(""myKeyVault"");
var secret = kv.GetSecret(""mySecret""); // New convenience method
```

### WithSecret APIs
Added three overloads of `WithSecret` method to populate Key Vault secrets:

```csharp
// Using IResourceBuilder<ParameterResource>
var secretParam = builder.AddParameter(""secretParam"", secret: true);
kv.WithSecret(""my-secret"", secretParam);

// Using ParameterResource directly  
kv.WithSecret(""my-secret"", secretParam.Resource);

// Using ReferenceExpression
var connectionString = ReferenceExpression.Create($""Server={server};Database={db}"");
kv.WithSecret(""connection-string"", connectionString);
```

### Secret Name Validation
Implemented proper validation following Azure Key Vault naming rules:
- 1-127 characters long
- ASCII letters (a-z, A-Z), digits (0-9), and dashes (-) only
- Rejects underscores, dots, spaces, and other invalid characters

### Bicep Infrastructure Integration
The `WithSecret` methods properly configure the Azure infrastructure to create `KeyVaultSecret` resources with correct parameter mapping and secure handling.

## Before/After Comparison

**Before** (manual infrastructure configuration):
```csharp
var secret = builder.AddParameter(""secretParam"", secret: true);
var kv = builder.AddAzureKeyVault(""kv"")
    .ConfigureInfrastructure(infra =>
    {
        var kv = infra.GetProvisionableResources().OfType<KeyVaultService>().Single();
        var secret = new KeyVaultSecret(""kvs"")
        {
            Name = secret.Name,
            Properties = new SecretProperties { Value = secret.AsProvisioningParameter(infra) },
            Parent = kv,
        };
        infra.Add(secret);
    });
```

**After** (simple API):
```csharp
var secret = builder.AddParameter(""secretParam"", secret: true);
var kv = builder.AddAzureKeyVault(""kv"")
    .WithSecret(""my-secret"", secret);
```

## Testing
Added comprehensive tests covering:
- GetSecret functionality validation
- Secret name validation with valid/invalid cases
- All three WithSecret overloads
- Proper error handling for invalid inputs

Fixes #9614.

3231624510,6021,Add missing tests for Assert.DoesNotContain string method overloads,"## Summary

This PR adds comprehensive test coverage for `Assert.DoesNotContain` string method overloads to prevent regression of the stackoverflow bug that was fixed in PR #5275/#5276.

## Problem

The comment from @nohwnd in PR #5276 identified that ""Some tests are probably missing, because otherwise this would be caught earlier?"" referring to a stackoverflow bug in `Assert.DoesNotContain` that was caused by circular method calls due to incorrect parameter ordering.

The issue was in these method overloads:

```csharp
// BEFORE (circular references causing stackoverflow):
public static void DoesNotContain(string substring, string value, string? message, params object?[]? parameters)
    => DoesNotContain(substring, value, message, StringComparison.Ordinal, parameters); // WRONG ORDER

public static void DoesNotContain(string substring, string value, StringComparison comparisonType, string? message)
    => DoesNotContain(substring, value, message, comparisonType, string.Empty); // WRONG ORDER
```

## Solution

Added comprehensive test coverage for all string `DoesNotContain` method overloads:

### 🎯 Critical Tests (would have caught the stackoverflow bug):
- `DoesNotContain_StringWithMessageAndParameters_*` - Tests the overload with message formatting
- `DoesNotContain_StringWithComparisonAndMessage_*` - Tests the overload with comparison and message

### 📋 Complete Coverage:
- `DoesNotContain_StringSimpleOverload_*` - Basic overload
- `DoesNotContain_StringWithMessageOnly_*` - Message-only overload
- Plus existing tests for the full overload

**Result: 10 total string DoesNotContain tests** covering all 6 method overloads with both success and failure cases.

## Impact

- **Regression Prevention**: If the circular reference bug is reintroduced, these tests will stackoverflow/timeout and fail the build
- **Complete Coverage**: All string DoesNotContain overloads now have proper test coverage
- **Future Safety**: Developers can be confident these methods work correctly

The tests specifically target the method signatures that had the parameter ordering issue and would have caught the stackoverflow bug during testing, preventing it from reaching production.

Fixes #5278.

3263156715,10673,Enhance orphan detection in Aspire AppHost to be robust against PID reuse,"## Problem

The current AppHost orphan detection mechanism only uses the `ASPIRE_CLI_PID` environment variable to check if the launching Aspire CLI process is still alive. This approach is vulnerable to PID reuse on some systems, where the OS may assign the same PID to a different process after the original CLI process dies. This can cause the AppHost to incorrectly continue running when it should have shut down.

## Solution

This PR enhances the orphan detection to be robust against PID reuse by:

1. **Adding process start time verification**: Introduces a new `ASPIRE_CLI_STARTED` environment variable that stores the CLI process start time in binary format
2. **Robust process checking**: The `CliOrphanDetector` now verifies both PID existence and start time match (with ±1 second tolerance) to conclusively determine if the monitored process is the same original CLI process
3. **Backwards compatibility**: Gracefully falls back to PID-only logic when the start time environment variable is not present or invalid

## Changes Made

### Core Implementation
- **`KnownConfigNames.cs`**: Added `CliProcessStarted` constant for the new `ASPIRE_CLI_STARTED` environment variable
- **`DotNetCliRunner.cs`**: Enhanced to set both `ASPIRE_CLI_PID` and `ASPIRE_CLI_STARTED` environment variables when launching AppHost processes
- **`CliOrphanDetector.cs`**: Added robust `IsProcessRunningWithStartTime` function and updated detection logic to use both PID and start time verification

### Testing
- Added comprehensive test coverage for new scenarios including:
  - Robust detection with start time verification
  - Backwards compatibility fallback
  - PID reuse detection
  - Invalid start time handling
  - Process lifecycle monitoring with enhanced detection

## Technical Details

- Uses `DateTime.ToBinary()` for reliable cross-platform start time serialization
- 1-second tolerance accommodates timing differences in process start detection
- Maintains full backwards compatibility with older CLI versions
- Minimal code changes with surgical precision

## Example Scenario

**Before**: If CLI process (PID 1234) dies and OS reuses PID 1234 for a different process, AppHost incorrectly continues running.

**After**: AppHost verifies both PID 1234 exists AND has the expected start time. If PID 1234 exists but has a different start time (indicating PID reuse), AppHost correctly shuts down.

## Testing

All changes have been thoroughly tested with:
- ✅ Successful compilation of all affected projects
- ✅ Manual verification of core logic (process start time verification, binary serialization)
- ✅ Comprehensive unit test coverage for new functionality
- ✅ Backwards compatibility validation

This enhancement significantly improves the reliability of Aspire's orphan detection while maintaining full backwards compatibility.

*This pull request was created as a result of the following prompt from Copilot chat.*
> Enhance orphan detection in Aspire AppHost to be robust against PID reuse. Currently, the AppHost only uses the ASPIRE_CLI_PID environment variable to detect if the launching Aspire CLI process is still alive, by checking for the PID. This is vulnerable to PID reuse on some systems. The solution is to set an additional environment variable, ASPIRE_CLI_STARTED, which stores the CLI process start time. The AppHost orphan detector (CliOrphanDetector) should check both the PID and the process start time (if present) to conclusively determine if the parent process is the same. If ASPIRE_CLI_STARTED is not present, fallback to PID-only logic for backwards compatibility. Also update relevant tests.

3262414990,6164,Fix codefix behavior for partial classes with TestCleanup and Dispose in different parts,"The `PreferDisposeOverTestCleanupFixer` was incorrectly handling partial classes where a `Dispose` method exists in one partial declaration and a `TestCleanup` method exists in another. This resulted in the codefix creating a duplicate `Dispose` method, causing compiler error CS0111.

## Problem

Consider this partial class scenario:

```csharp
public partial class MyTestClass : IDisposable
{
    public void Dispose()
    {
        int x = 1;
    }
}

[TestClass]
public partial class MyTestClass
{
    [TestCleanup]
    public void MyTestCleanup()
    {
        int y = 1;
    }
}
```

The old fixer logic only searched for `Dispose` methods within the current partial class declaration (`containingType.Members`), so it would not find the existing `Dispose` method in the other partial declaration. This caused it to create a new `Dispose` method in the second partial class, resulting in:

```csharp
// Incorrect output with CS0111 error
[TestClass]
public partial class MyTestClass : IDisposable
{
    public void Dispose()  // ❌ Duplicate method definition
    {
        int y = 1;
    }
}
```

## Solution

Updated the fixer to use `typeSymbol.GetMembers(""Dispose"")` which searches across all parts of a partial class. The fix now correctly:

1. Finds the existing `Dispose` method in any partial declaration
2. Appends the `TestCleanup` method body to the existing `Dispose` method
3. Removes the `TestCleanup` method

Result:
```csharp
public partial class MyTestClass : IDisposable
{
    public void Dispose()
    {
        int x = 1;
        int y = 1;  // ✅ TestCleanup body appended
    }
}

[TestClass]
public partial class MyTestClass
{
    // ✅ TestCleanup method removed
}
```

## Changes

- **PreferDisposeOverTestCleanupFixer.cs**: Enhanced to detect `Dispose` methods across all partial class declarations using semantic model
- **PreferDisposeOverTestCleanupAnalyzerTests.cs**: Updated test expectation from broken behavior (CS0111 error) to correct behavior
- Added safeguard to only handle `Dispose` methods in the same document

Fixes #4181.

3192892401,10166,Add package ID filtering to VersionFetcher.GetLatestVersion for robustness,"## Summary

Updates the `GetLatestVersion` method in `VersionFetcher.cs` to filter packages so that only those with the ID ""Aspire.Hosting.AppHost"" are considered when determining the latest version.

## Problem

Although the CLI command `dotnet package search Aspire.Hosting.AppHost --format json` should already limit results to the target package according to NuGet search syntax, there's a potential for the CLI output to include unexpected packages. This could lead to incorrect version determination if other packages with higher version numbers are included in the results.

## Solution

Added explicit package ID filtering in the `GetLatestVersion` method:

```csharp
// Filter packages to only consider ""Aspire.Hosting.AppHost"".
// Although the CLI command 'dotnet package search Aspire.Hosting.AppHost --format json' 
// should already limit results according to NuGet search syntax 
// (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/consume-packages/finding-and-choosing-packages#search-syntax),
// we add this extra check for robustness in case the CLI output includes unexpected packages.
if (package.Id == ""Aspire.Hosting.AppHost"" && 
    SemVersion.TryParse(package.LatestVersion, out var version) && 
    !version.IsPrerelease)
{
    versions.Add(version);
}
```

## Changes Made

1. **Added package ID filtering**: Only packages with `Id == ""Aspire.Hosting.AppHost""` are now considered for version parsing
2. **Added comprehensive documentation**: Comment references the [NuGet search syntax documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/consume-packages/finding-and-choosing-packages#search-syntax) and explains the robustness rationale
3. **Added test coverage**: New test `GetLatestVersion_MixedPackageIds_OnlyConsidersAppHostPackages` verifies that non-matching packages are filtered out
4. **Preserved existing logic**: All original functionality and structure maintained

## Testing

- All existing tests continue to pass (3 original tests)
- New test validates filtering behavior by including a mock package ""SomeOther.Package"" with version 99.0.0 and verifying it's ignored in favor of the correct ""Aspire.Hosting.AppHost"" packages
- Total test coverage: 4 tests, all passing

## Impact

This change provides an extra layer of robustness to ensure version checking always considers only the intended Aspire.Hosting.AppHost package, even if the CLI search results include unexpected packages.

3234862868,6055,Add diagnostic suppressor for IDE0060 warnings on TestContext parameters in MSTest fixture methods,"This PR implements a diagnostic suppressor to resolve IDE0060 warnings for unused TestContext parameters in AssemblyInitialize and ClassInitialize methods.

## Problem

MSTest requires that AssemblyInitialize and ClassInitialize methods have a single parameter of type TestContext. When this parameter is not used in the method body, the Roslyn analyzer IDE0060 reports a warning:

```
warning IDE0060: Remove unused parameter 'context' if it is not part of a shipped public API
```

This creates a dilemma for developers:
- The parameter is required by MSTest framework specification
- Removing it would break the test framework contract
- Adding `#pragma warning disable` clutters the code

## Solution

Added `UnusedParameterSuppressor` (MSTEST0047) that automatically suppresses IDE0060 warnings specifically for:
- ✅ TestContext parameters in methods marked with `[AssemblyInitialize]`
- ✅ TestContext parameters in methods marked with `[ClassInitialize]`
- ❌ Other unused parameters (still show warnings as expected)

## Example

**Before:**
```csharp
[TestClass]
public class MyTests
{
    [AssemblyInitialize]
    public static void Setup(TestContext context)  // IDE0060 warning
    {
        // TestContext unused but required by MSTest
    }
}
```

**After:**
```csharp
[TestClass]
public class MyTests
{
    [AssemblyInitialize]
    public static void Setup(TestContext context)  // No warning
    {
        // TestContext unused but required by MSTest
    }
}
```

## Implementation Details

- **Diagnostic ID**: MSTEST0047
- **Suppressed Diagnostic**: IDE0060
- **Scope**: Only TestContext parameters in AssemblyInitialize/ClassInitialize methods
- **Justification**: ""TestContext parameter is required by MSTest for AssemblyInitialize and ClassInitialize methods""
- **Language Support**: C# and Visual Basic
- **Localization**: Full support for all 13 supported languages

The suppressor follows the established patterns in the codebase and includes comprehensive test coverage for both positive and negative scenarios.

Fixes #6053.

- `ExecuteCommandAsync_HasReplicas_Success_CalledPerReplica` (Issue #9833)
- `ExecuteCommandAsync_HasReplicas_Failure_CalledPerReplica` (Issue #9834)

The tests are marked with the `QuarantinedTest` attribute to move them from the regular test workflow to the outerloop workflow, preventing build failures while the underlying flakiness is investigated and resolved.

**Changes made:**
- Added `using Aspire.TestUtilities;` import
- Added `[QuarantinedTest(""https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/issues/9833"")]` to the success test
- Added `[QuarantinedTest(""https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/issues/9834"")]` to the failure test

This follows the established pattern for quarantining flaky tests in the Aspire codebase, ensuring these tests continue to run in the outerloop workflow while not blocking regular CI builds.

## Summary

Successfully implemented batch PR fetching with GraphQL API in `dev/update_changelog.py`, providing significant performance improvement while maintaining exact same functionality.

### Key Changes Made:

1. **Added `batch_fetch_prs_graphql()`** - Main function that orchestrates batch fetching
2. **Added `_fetch_pr_chunk_graphql()`** - Helper that handles individual GraphQL requests  
3. **Modified `main()` function** - Changed from sequential individual API calls to batch approach:
   - Extract all PR numbers from git log first
   - Batch fetch all PR data with GraphQL
   - Create PullRequest objects from batch results

### Performance Improvement:

- **Before**: N individual REST API calls (GET `/repos/mlflow/mlflow/pulls/{pr_num}`)
- **After**: ⌈N/50⌉ batch GraphQL calls (POST `/graphql` with up to 50 PRs per request)
- **Typical improvement**: 5-50x fewer API calls depending on release size
- **Example**: 100 PRs now requires 2 API calls instead of 100 (50x improvement)

### Technical Details:

- Uses GitHub GraphQL API with dynamic query generation and aliases
- Chunks large requests (>50 PRs) to respect API limits
- Maintains same output format for compatibility
- Includes proper error handling for missing/invalid PRs
- All existing functionality and CLI interface preserved unchanged

### Validation:

- ✅ All imports and syntax correct
- ✅ CLI interface unchanged
- ✅ Core functionality preserved  
- ✅ Performance characteristics validated
- ✅ Code passes all linting/formatting checks
- ✅ Handles edge cases (empty lists, missing PRs)

The implementation is backward-compatible and ready for production use.

Fixes #16038.

Original description:

> The Aspire CLI currently implements 'aspire config' as a command with subcommands for 'set', 'list', 'get', and 'delete'. This should be refactored so that only 'aspire config' exists as a command, and the operations 'set', 'list', 'get', and 'delete' are handled as verbs (the first argument to 'config') rather than as subcommands. For maintainability, ensure that the implementation for each operation (set, get, list, delete) is in a separate method. Update command registration, parsing, and documentation/comments as needed. Add or update tests to cover the new invocation style and verify backwards-incompatible subcommand removal. Do not change any files under '*/api/*.cs'. Follow repo conventions and .editorconfig formatting.

</p>
</details>

The test `test_databricks_sdk_retry_backoff_calculation` in `tests/utils/test_rest_utils.py` was using a try/except pattern to handle expected exceptions, but it should use `pytest.raises` for better test clarity and to ensure the correct exception is raised.

## Changes Made

**Before:**
```python
try:
    _retry_databricks_sdk_call_with_exponential_backoff(
        call_func=mock_failing_call,
        retry_codes=_TRANSIENT_FAILURE_RESPONSE_CODES,
        retry_timeout_seconds=10,
        backoff_factor=1,
        backoff_jitter=0,
        max_retries=3,
    )
except Exception:
    pass  # Expected to fail
```

**After:**
```python
with pytest.raises(DatabricksError, match=""Mock error""):
    _retry_databricks_sdk_call_with_exponential_backoff(
        call_func=mock_failing_call,
        retry_codes=_TRANSIENT_FAILURE_RESPONSE_CODES,
        retry_timeout_seconds=10,
        backoff_factor=1,
        backoff_jitter=0,
        max_retries=3,
    )
```

## Benefits

- **More explicit**: Now specifically expects `DatabricksError` instead of any generic `Exception`
- **Better error reporting**: If the wrong exception type is raised or the message doesn't match, pytest provides clear error information
- **Follows pytest conventions**: Consistent with other tests in the same file and pytest best practices
- **Improved maintainability**: The code intent is clearer and more readable

## Technical Details

- Moved `DatabricksError` import to function level for better organization
- Added specific error message matching (`match=""Mock error""`) to satisfy linting requirements
- Maintained all existing test assertions and logic
- All pre-commit checks pass

Fixes #16225.

## Changes Made

- **Added new interface**: `IAzureComputeEnvironmentResource` in the `Aspire.Hosting.Azure` namespace
- **Updated implementations**: Both `AzureContainerAppEnvironmentResource` and `AzureAppServiceEnvironmentResource` now implement the new interface instead of `IComputeEnvironmentResource` directly
- **Maintained backward compatibility**: Since `IAzureComputeEnvironmentResource` extends `IComputeEnvironmentResource`, existing code continues to work
- **Added unit tests**: Tests verify that both Azure compute environment resources implement the new interface
- **Updated API surface**: Automatically regenerated to include the new interface definition

## API Design

```csharp
namespace Aspire.Hosting.Azure;

[Experimental(""ASPIRECOMPUTE001"", UrlFormat = ""https://aka.ms/aspire/diagnostics/{0}"")]
public interface IAzureComputeEnvironmentResource : IComputeEnvironmentResource
{
}
```

## Usage

Consumers can now distinguish between Azure and non-Azure compute environments:

```csharp
if (computeEnvironment is IAzureComputeEnvironmentResource azureEnv)
{
    // Handle Azure-specific logic
}
else
{
    // Handle other compute environments (Docker, Kubernetes, etc.)
}
```

3119857154,16080,Enhance check-vcs-permalinks pre-commit hook configuration,"This PR adds the `check-vcs-permalinks` pre-commit hook to ensure VCS permalinks across the codebase use permanent commit hashes instead of branch names.

## Changes Made

Added `check-vcs-permalinks` hook to `.pre-commit-config.yaml`:

```yaml
- id: check-vcs-permalinks
  files: \.(py|md|mdx|rst|yaml|yml)$
  require_serial: true
```

## Benefits

- **Consistency**: Ensures all VCS permalinks follow the same permanent format
- **Maintenance**: Helps identify and fix outdated or non-permanent links
- **Documentation Quality**: Improves reliability of links in documentation and code
- **Expanded Coverage**: Checks multiple file types where VCS permalinks might be present

## File Types Covered

The hook now checks for VCS permalinks in:
- Python files (`.py`)
- Markdown files (`.md`, `.mdx`) 
- reStructuredText files (`.rst`)
- YAML configuration files (`.yaml`, `.yml`)

## What It Detects

The hook identifies GitHub URLs that use branch names instead of commit hashes:

❌ **Non-permanent** (will be flagged):
```
https://github.com/owner/repo/blob/main/file.py#L10
https://github.com/owner/repo/blob/master/file.py#L20
```

✅ **Permanent** (will pass):
```
https://github.com/owner/repo/blob/9db0f205adcf315d16961fea7e9e6906cb950d43/file.py#L10
```

## Testing

- Hook successfully integrates with existing pre-commit workflow
- Tested on various file types across the repository
- Found 7 existing non-permanent links that maintainers can address in future PRs
- Does not break any existing functionality

Fixes #16078.

3157787774,9939,Fix SqlServer PowerShell module version to avoid breaking changes in 22.4.5.1,"## Summary

Updates all provisioning scripts to pin the SqlServer PowerShell module to version 22.3.0 to avoid breaking changes introduced in version 22.4.5.1.

## Problem

The current provisioning scripts use:
```powershell
Install-Module -Name SqlServer -Force -AllowClobber -Scope CurrentUser
```

This installs the latest version of the SqlServer module, which can include breaking changes. Version 22.4.5.1 introduced breaking changes that affect the deployment scripts.

## Solution

Changed all instances to specify the last known working version:
```powershell
# Install SqlServer module - using specific version to avoid breaking changes in 22.4.5.1 (see https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/issues/9926)
Install-Module -Name SqlServer -RequiredVersion 22.3.0 -Force -AllowClobber -Scope CurrentUser
```

## Files Changed

- **Source template**: `src/Aspire.Hosting.Azure.Sql/AzureSqlServerResource.cs` - Updated the PowerShell script template
- **Bicep modules**: Updated 6 Bicep files containing embedded PowerShell scripts:
  - `playground/SqlServerScript/AppHost1/api1-roles-mysqlserver.module.bicep`
  - `playground/SqlServerScript/AppHost1/api2-roles-mysqlserver.module.bicep`
  - `playground/SqlServerEndToEnd/SqlServerEndToEnd.AppHost/sql1-roles.module.bicep`
  - `playground/SqlServerEndToEnd/SqlServerEndToEnd.AppHost/sql2-roles.module.bicep`
  - `playground/bicep/BicepSample.AppHost/sql-roles.module.bicep`
  - `playground/cdk/CdkSample.AppHost/sql-roles.module.bicep`

## Testing

- ✅ All Bicep files compile successfully with `az bicep build`
- ✅ C# project builds without errors
- ✅ All changes are minimal (1-2 lines per file)

Fixes #9926

3157958459,5818,Fix TypeContainingTestMethodShouldBeATestClassAnalyzer to handle structs with TestMethod,"## Description

Fixes #5621 - The `TypeContainingTestMethodShouldBeATestClassAnalyzer` was not triggering warnings for structs containing `[TestMethod]` attributes.

## Problem

Previously, the analyzer only checked classes for test methods, meaning this code would not produce any warning:

```csharp
public struct TestStruct
{
    [TestMethod]
    public void TestMethod1()
    {
    }
}
```

This was problematic because test methods in structs without the `[TestClass]` attribute are silently ignored by the test framework.

## Solution

- **Modified the analyzer logic** to examine both classes and structs for test methods
- **Updated error message** from ""Class '{0}' contains test methods..."" to ""Type '{0}' contains test methods..."" to be more generic
- **Updated all localization files** (xlf) with the new message format and marked translations for update
- **Added comprehensive test cases** covering both positive and negative scenarios for structs

## Changes Made

1. **TypeContainingTestMethodShouldBeATestClassAnalyzer.cs**: Changed type filter from `TypeKind.Class` only to `TypeKind.Class && TypeKind.Struct`
2. **Resources files**: Updated message format to use ""Type"" instead of ""Class""
3. **Test coverage**: Added tests for structs with and without test methods

## Verification

The fix ensures that:
- ✅ Structs with `[TestMethod]` now trigger the analyzer warning
- ✅ Structs without test methods don't trigger false positives  
- ✅ Existing behavior for classes remains unchanged
- ✅ Other types (interfaces, enums) continue to be excluded as expected

Fixes #5621

3157968978,5819,Improve DataRow type mismatch error messages with descriptive parameter information,"## Summary

Improves the error message for DataRow type mismatches to provide clear, actionable information instead of confusing coordinate-like indices.

## Problem

The current error message for DataRow type mismatches shows indices that look like coordinates, making it difficult for developers to understand what's wrong:

```csharp
[DataRow(""Luxury Car"", ""Alice Johnson"", 1500.00, ""https://example.com/luxurycar.jpg"", ""https://example.com/luxurycar"")]
public void AddGift_ShouldRejectExpensiveGifts(string name, string reservedBy, decimal price, string imageUrl, string link)
```

**Before:** `DataRow argument type should match method parameter type. Mismatches occur at indices: (2, 2)`

This message is precise but unclear - it's not obvious that index 2 refers to the `price` parameter or that the issue is a `double` vs `decimal` type mismatch.

## Solution

**After:** `DataRow argument types do not match method parameter types. Parameter 'price' expects type 'decimal', but the provided value has type 'double'`

This new message clearly identifies:
- Which parameter has the issue (`price`)
- What type is expected (`decimal`)
- What type was actually provided (`double`)

## Changes Made

1. **Updated error message format** in `Resources.resx` and all localization files
2. **Modified analyzer logic** in `DataRowShouldBeValidAnalyzer.cs` to:
   - Collect parameter names, expected types, and actual types instead of indices
   - Use `ITypeSymbol.ToDisplayString()` for readable type names
   - Report the first type mismatch with descriptive information
3. **Updated tests** to expect the new message format
4. **Added new test** specifically for the decimal/double scenario mentioned in the issue

## Examples

### Decimal vs Double (from issue)
```csharp
[DataRow(1500.00)] // double literal
public void Test(decimal price) // decimal parameter
```
Error: `Parameter 'price' expects type 'decimal', but the provided value has type 'double'`

### String vs Int
```csharp
[DataRow(1, 2, 3)] // int literal
public void Test(int i, int j, string s) // string parameter
```
Error: `Parameter 's' expects type 'string', but the provided value has type 'int'`

### Array Type Mismatch
```csharp
[DataRow(1)] // int literal  
public void Test(object[] o) // array parameter
```
Error: `Parameter 'o' expects type 'object[]', but the provided value has type 'int'`

Fixes #4996

## Changes Made

1. **Added `%source_pr_author%` placeholder** to the description of both `pr_title_template` and `pr_description_template` inputs
2. **Updated default PR title template** from `[%target_branch%] %source_pr_title%` to `[%target_branch%] %source_pr_title% by %source_pr_author%`
3. **Added replacement logic** for the new placeholder using `context.payload.issue.user.login` in the PR title calculation step

## Example

Before:
```
[release/3.8.x] Fix memory leak in test discovery
```

After:
```
[release/3.8.x] Fix memory leak in test discovery by @johndoe
```

The `%source_pr_author%` placeholder uses the same data source (`context.payload.issue.user.login`) that is already used elsewhere in the workflow for identifying the original PR author, ensuring consistency and reliability.

Fixes #5665.

3126630055,9752,Fix Azure Container Apps deployment failure with uppercase resource names,"## Problem

Adding project references with uppercase names (e.g., `""WebFrontEnd""`) would work fine locally but cause deployment failures when publishing to Azure Container Apps:

```
Error: Invalid ContainerApp name 'WebFrontEnd'. A name must consist of lower case alphanumeric characters or '-', start with an alphabetic character, and end with an alphanumeric character and cannot have '--'. The length must not be more than 32 characters.
```

## Root Cause

While the Container App's `Name` property was being set to lowercase, the Bicep resource identifier was still using the original uppercase name. Azure Container Apps require lowercase names, but the generated Bicep template contained uppercase identifiers, causing deployment failures.

## Solution

Updated `ContainerAppContext.cs` to ensure both the Bicep resource identifier and container names are lowercase:

1. **Line 59**: Fixed Bicep identifier creation to use lowercase name:
   ```csharp
   var containerAppResource = new ContainerApp(Infrastructure.NormalizeBicepIdentifier(resource.Name.ToLowerInvariant()))
   ```

2. **Line 104**: Fixed container name to use lowercase:
   ```csharp
   containerAppContainer.Name = resource.Name.ToLowerInvariant();
   ```

## Testing

- Added comprehensive test `ContainerAppWithUppercaseName_ShouldUseLowercaseInManifest` 
- Verified that uppercase ""WebFrontEnd"" correctly becomes lowercase ""webfrontend"" in generated Bicep
- All 46 Azure Container Apps tests pass with no regressions

## Developer Experience

- Developers can continue using any casing they prefer (e.g., ""WebFrontEnd"", ""MyApi"")
- Names are automatically converted to comply with Azure Container Apps requirements
- No breaking changes or additional warnings needed
- Deployments now succeed reliably

This approach is consistent with existing Azure naming patterns throughout the codebase where automatic lowercase conversion is commonly used.

Fixes #4505.

- `tests/Aspire.Hosting.Azure.Tests/Snapshots/`
- `tests/Aspire.Hosting.Docker.Tests/Snapshots/`
- `tests/Aspire.Hosting.Kubernetes.Tests/Snapshots/`

When coding agents modify tests that use snapshot testing, they need a way to accept the new snapshots. The verify tool provides this capability through the `dotnet verify accept -y` command.

Fixes #9621.

3186299556,10120,Add console output after choice selection in publish command,"## Summary

After a user selects a choice in the publish command, the prompt text and selected value are now displayed in the console output to ensure the user's selection remains visible.

## Problem

When users made selections in choice prompts during the publish command, their selection would disappear from the console after the prompt completed, making it unclear what option was chosen. This could be confusing during long publish operations where multiple choices might be made.

## Solution

Added a single line in `HandleSelectInputAsync` that uses `AnsiConsole.MarkupLine` to display both the prompt text and the selected choice value:

```csharp
AnsiConsole.MarkupLine($""{promptText.EscapeMarkup()} {selectedChoice.Value.EscapeMarkup()}"");
```

### Key features:
- **Proper escaping**: Both `promptText` and `selectedChoice.Value` are escaped using `.EscapeMarkup()` to prevent formatting issues with special characters
- **Minimal impact**: Only affects the choice selection code path when `input.Options` is available
- **Consistent formatting**: Uses the same markup escaping pattern already established in the codebase

## Example

When a user selects ""US East (N. Virginia)"" for a ""Select region:"" prompt, the console will now display:
```
Select region: US East (N. Virginia)
```

## Testing

- All existing tests pass (93/93)
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- The implementation follows existing code patterns in the same file

## Files Changed

- `src/Aspire.Cli/Commands/PublishCommandBase.cs` - Added console output after choice selection

3236393939,10459,Fix CLI install script printing unexpected '0' when executed via iex,"## Problem

When running the CLI install script using `iex` (Invoke-Expression), an unexpected `0` was printed at the end of the output:

```powershell
❯ iex ""& { $(irm https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/raw/refs/heads/main/eng/scripts/get-aspire-cli.ps1) }""
Downloading from: https://aka.ms/dotnet/9.0/daily/aspire-cli-win-x64.zip
Aspire CLI successfully installed to: C:\Users\eerhardt\.aspire\bin\aspire.exe

The aspire cli is now available for use in this and new sessions.
0
```

The trailing `0` was confusing and provided no useful information to users.

## Root Cause

The issue occurred because when the script is executed via `iex`, the `$PSCommandPath` variable is empty, causing `$InvokedFromFile` to be `false`. This led the script to use `return $exitCode` instead of `exit $exitCode`. When using `iex`, the return value gets printed to the console, hence the unexpected `0`.

## Solution

Modified the script to only return values on error cases when not invoked from a file, and avoid returning anything on success:

1. **Help case (line 67)**: Removed the `return 0` for non-file execution
2. **Main execution (line 639)**: Only return error codes (`$exitCode -ne 0`) for non-file execution

## Behavior Changes

- ✅ **Success cases via `iex`**: No longer print `0` 
- ✅ **Error cases via `iex`**: Still return error codes for proper error handling in dot-sourced scenarios
- ✅ **File execution**: Unchanged (continues to use exit codes properly)
- ✅ **PowerShell version check errors**: Unchanged (still returns error codes)

The fix ensures users will no longer see the unexpected `0` when running the install command, while preserving proper error handling for all execution contexts.

Fixes #10458.

3158655778,9946,"Inject DOTNET_CLI_USE_MSBUILD_SERVER env var for apphost builds and runs, using configuration for value","Fixes #9945

This PR implements the enhancement to the Aspire CLI to always set the `DOTNET_CLI_USE_MSBUILD_SERVER` environment variable for all dotnet build and dotnet run (when noBuild == false) calls for apphost projects.

## Changes Made

### Core Implementation
- **Modified `DotNetCliRunner`** to accept `IConfiguration` dependency via constructor
- **Added `GetMsBuildServerValue()` helper method** that reads from `configuration[""DOTNET_CLI_USE_MSBUILD_SERVER""]` with default value of `""true""`
- **Updated `BuildAsync()`** to always inject the environment variable before calling `ExecuteAsync`
- **Updated `RunAsync()`** to inject the environment variable only when `noBuild == false`, preserving existing environment variables
- **Updated service registration** in `Program.cs` to provide `IConfiguration` to `DotNetCliRunner`

### Test Coverage
Added comprehensive tests to verify:
- Environment variable defaults to `""true""` when not set in configuration
- Environment variable can be overridden via configuration for testing or explicit opt-out
- Environment variable is always present for builds
- Environment variable is only present for runs when `noBuild == false`
- Existing environment variables are preserved when injecting the new variable

## Technical Implementation Details

✅ Always inject the `DOTNET_CLI_USE_MSBUILD_SERVER` environment variable into the environment dictionary passed to the build/run process for apphost builds
✅ The value is sourced from `configuration[""DOTNET_CLI_USE_MSBUILD_SERVER""]` with fallback to `""true""`
✅ Never check for or rely on any preexisting value in the env dictionary; always explicitly set the variable
✅ In `BuildAsync()`: Always inject the variable before calling `ExecuteAsync`
✅ In `RunAsync()`: Inject the variable only if `noBuild == false`, before calling `ExecuteAsync`
✅ `DotNetCliRunner` has access to `IConfiguration` instance via dependency injection

## Testing
- All existing CLI tests continue to pass (70/70)
- Added 5 new focused tests covering the environment variable injection behavior
- Tests verify default values, configuration overrides, and conditional injection based on `noBuild` parameter

The implementation is minimal and surgical, preserving all existing functionality while adding the required environment variable injection capability.

Thanks for assigning this issue to me. I'm starting to work on it and will keep this PR's description up to date as I form a plan and make progress.

Original issue description:

> ## Problem Statement
> 
> The current implementation of `OsEnvironSetInTest` and `OsEnvironDeleteInTest` rules in `dev/clint/src/clint/rules.py` only detect direct usage of `os.environ` (e.g., `os.environ[""KEY""] = value`). They don't catch cases where `os.environ` is imported with an alias or accessed through a different import path (e.g., `from os import environ; environ[""KEY""] = value`).
> 
> ## Motivation
> 
> By using the resolver functionality that's already available in the codebase, we can make these rules more robust and catch all variations of `os.environ` usage in tests, regardless of how it was imported. This will ensure better compliance with the testing best practice of using `monkeypatch.setenv` and `monkeypatch.delenv` instead of directly modifying `os.environ`.
> 
> ## Proposed Solution
> 
> Add a `check` method to both `OsEnvironSetInTest` and `OsEnvironDeleteInTest` rules that accepts `ast.Assign` or `ast.Delete` nodes respectively and uses the resolver to determine if the target is actually `os.environ`, regardless of how it was imported.
> 
> ## Implementation Plan
> 
> A detailed implementation plan is available at: `.claude/plans/20250619_1715_improve_os_environ_detection.md`
> 
> ### Summary of changes needed:
> 
> 1. **Add check method to OsEnvironSetInTest rule** in `dev/clint/src/clint/rules.py`
> 2. **Add check method to OsEnvironDeleteInTest rule** in `dev/clint/src/clint/rules.py`
> 3. **Update linter.py** to use the new check methods instead of the current `_is_os_environ` approach
> 
> ### Test cases to cover:
> - Direct usage: `os.environ[""KEY""] = ""value""`
> - Aliased import: `import os as o; o.environ[""KEY""] = ""value""`
> - Direct environ import: `from os import environ; environ[""KEY""] = ""value""`
> - Aliased environ import: `from os import environ as env; env[""KEY""] = ""value""`

## Changes
- Removed `flaml[automl]` and its associated comment from `test-requirements.txt`
- No code changes were needed as FLAML was not being imported or used anywhere in the codebase

## Verification
- Confirmed no Python files in the repository import or reference FLAML
- Verified that all ""automl"" references in tests are related to `databricks.automl`, not FLAML
- Validated that the requirements file remains syntactically correct after the removal
- All existing pre-commit hooks pass successfully

This is a minimal cleanup change that removes an unused test dependency without affecting any functionality.

3198732250,16551,Rewrite dev/preview_docs.py in JavaScript to simplify preview-docs workflow,"This PR rewrites the `dev/preview_docs.py` Python script in JavaScript to simplify the preview-docs workflow and eliminate unnecessary dependencies.

## Problem

The current `preview-docs.yml` workflow required both Node.js (for Netlify deployment) and Python (for PR comment management), leading to:
- Slower CI runs due to Python environment setup
- Additional dependency management (`pip install requests`)
- Workflow complexity with multiple language environments

## Solution

Replaced the Python script with a JavaScript implementation that uses the `github-script` action:

### Changes Made

1. **Created `.github/workflows/preview-docs.js`** - JavaScript version with identical functionality
2. **Updated `.github/workflows/preview-docs.yml`** - Replaced Python script calls with `github-script` actions  
3. **Removed `dev/preview_docs.py`** - Original Python script no longer needed

### Key Benefits

✅ **Faster CI runs** - Eliminates `setup-python` action  
✅ **Fewer dependencies** - No more `pip install requests`  
✅ **Simpler workflow** - Uses built-in GitHub API access  
✅ **Consistency** - Follows existing JavaScript patterns in the repository  
✅ **100% compatibility** - Maintains same comment templates and behavior  

### Technical Details

The JavaScript implementation preserves all original functionality:
- Same `<!-- documentation preview -->` marker system
- Handles both ""completed"" and ""failed"" stages
- Creates/updates PR comments with identical templates
- Uses the same GitHub API endpoints and error handling

### Before/After Comparison

**Before:**
```yaml
- uses: ./.github/actions/setup-python
- name: Install dependencies
  run: pip install requests
- name: Create preview link
  run: |
    python dev/preview_docs.py \
      --commit-sha ${{ github.event.workflow_run.head_sha }} \
      --pull-number $PR_NUMBER \
      # ... other args
```

**After:**
```yaml
- name: Create preview link
  uses: actions/github-script@60a0d83039c74a4aee543508d2ffcb1c3799cdea
  env:
    COMMIT_SHA: ${{ github.event.workflow_run.head_sha }}
    PULL_NUMBER: ${{ github.event.workflow_run.pull_requests[0].number }}
    # ... other env vars
  with:
    script: |
      const script = require(`${process.env.GITHUB_WORKSPACE}/.github/workflows/preview-docs.js`);
      await script({ context, github, env: process.env });
```

This addresses the TODO comment in the original Python script:
```python
# TODO: rewrite this in JavaScript so we don't have to setup both node (to deploy to netlify)
# and python (to upsert pr comments with this script)
```

Fixes #16550.

- The test will now run in the outerloop workflow (`tests-outerloop.yml`) instead of the regular tests workflow (`tests.yml`)

## Background

The `QuarantinedTest` attribute is used to mark tests that are flaky and don't fail deterministically. These tests are excluded from regular CI runs to prevent false failures, but are still executed in the outerloop workflow to monitor their behavior.

The attribute follows the established pattern used by other quarantined tests in the same file and references the GitHub issue tracking the underlying flakiness.

3255641734,10627,Always set MSBUILDTERMINALLOGGER=false for all dotnet command executions in DotNetCliRunner,"## Summary

Updates `DotNetCliRunner` to ensure that the `MSBUILDTERMINALLOGGER=false` environment variable is always set for any dotnet command execution. This guarantees consistent terminal logger behavior across all dotnet invocations spawned by the Aspire CLI.

## Problem

Previously, there was no consistent way to ensure that all dotnet processes spawned by the Aspire CLI would have the MSBuild terminal logger enabled. This could lead to inconsistent build output formatting and logging behavior depending on which method was used to invoke dotnet commands.

## Solution

The implementation adds the environment variable setting to the central `ExecuteAsync` method in `DotNetCliRunner`, ensuring that every dotnet process gets consistent terminal logger behavior without code duplication.

### Changes Made

1. **Added constant for environment variable name**:
   - Added `MsBuildTerminalLogger = ""MSBUILDTERMINALLOGGER""` to `KnownConfigNames.cs`

2. **Modified ExecuteAsync to always set the environment variable**:
   ```csharp
   // Always set MSBUILDTERMINALLOGGER=false for all dotnet command executions to ensure consistent terminal logger behavior
   startInfo.EnvironmentVariables[KnownConfigNames.MsBuildTerminalLogger] = ""false"";
   ```

## Benefits

- ✅ **Avoids duplication**: Set once in the central ExecuteAsync method
- ✅ **Guarantees consistency**: Every dotnet process spawned by Aspire CLI has MSBUILDTERMINALLOGGER=false
- ✅ **Minimal changes**: Only 2 lines of core implementation code + 1 constant + tests
- ✅ **Preserves existing functionality**: All existing behavior is maintained

## Testing

All existing tests continue to pass, and new tests specifically validate that:
- MSBUILDTERMINALLOGGER=false is set for all dotnet command executions
- The environment variable is always set to ""false"" regardless of input values
- Existing environment variables are preserved

This ensures consistent MSBuild terminal logger behavior across all dotnet invocations, regardless of which method calls ExecuteAsync.

*This pull request was created as a result of the following prompt from Copilot chat.*
> Update DotNetCliRunner so that the MSBUILDTERMINALLOGGER=false environment variable is always set for any dotnet command execution. This should be implemented by adding or overriding this environment variable in the ExecuteAsync method, ensuring every dotnet process spawned by Aspire CLI has this variable set. This approach should avoid duplication and guarantee consistent behavior across all dotnet invocations, regardless of which method calls ExecuteAsync.

3154630091,5804,Fix UTA023 error for OwnerAttribute and PriorityAttribute in MSTest 3.10.0-preview,"## Problem

MSTest 3.10.0-preview incorrectly throws ""UTA023: Cannot define predefined property Owner on method"" when using the built-in `OwnerAttribute` or `PriorityAttribute` on test methods.

```csharp
[TestMethod]
[Owner(""test_owner"")]  // ❌ Fails with UTA023 error
public void TestMethod() { }

[TestMethod]
[Priority(1)]          // ❌ Fails with UTA023 error  
public void TestMethod2() { }
```

## Root Cause

Both `OwnerAttribute` and `PriorityAttribute` inherit from `TestPropertyAttribute` and set their respective property names (""Owner"" and ""Priority""). The `TypeCache.ValidateAndAssignTestProperty()` method was incorrectly treating these legitimate MSTest framework attributes as forbidden custom properties due to their inclusion in the `PredefinedNames` array.

## Solution

- **Removed ""Priority"" and ""Owner""** from the `PredefinedNames` array in `TypeCache.cs`
- **Kept ""TestCategory""** in the array since `TestCategoryAttribute` uses a different inheritance pattern (`TestCategoryBaseAttribute`) and should remain protected
- **Updated tests** to reflect the change and verify the fix works correctly

**Before:**
```csharp
private static readonly string[] PredefinedNames = [""Priority"", ""TestCategory"", ""Owner""];
```

**After:**
```csharp
private static readonly string[] PredefinedNames = [""TestCategory""];
```

## Impact

- ✅ `[Owner(""name"")]` and `[Priority(1)]` attributes now work without UTA023 errors
- ✅ Custom `[TestProperty(""TestCategory"", ""value"")]` is still properly blocked
- ✅ No breaking changes - only enables previously blocked framework functionality

Fixes #5803.

3120162244,16088,Add custom lint rule to detect @pytest.mark.repeat decorator,"## Problem

The `@pytest.mark.repeat` decorator is used for local testing to repeat tests and check for flakiness, but it should not be committed to the repository as it's only meant for debugging purposes.

## Solution

Added a new custom lint rule `PytestMarkRepeat` (MLF0023) to the clint linter that:

- Detects `@pytest.mark.repeat` and `@pytest.mark.repeat(n)` decorators in test functions
- Only applies to test files (files starting with `test_`)
- Works for both sync and async functions
- Correctly ignores aliases like `pt.mark.repeat` or direct imports like `mark.repeat`
- Provides clear error message explaining the decorator should not be committed

## Example

The linter now catches cases like this:

```python
import pytest

# This will be flagged by the linter:
@pytest.mark.repeat(10)
def test_something():
    pass

# This will also be flagged:
@pytest.mark.repeat
def test_another():
    pass

# These will NOT be flagged:
@pytest.mark.parametrize(""x"", [1, 2, 3])
def test_param(x):
    pass

@pytest.fixture
def my_fixture():
    pass
```

## Implementation Details

- Added `PytestMarkRepeat` rule class in `dev/clint/src/clint/rules.py`
- Integrated decorator detection logic into the linter's AST visitor pattern
- Rule uses AST analysis to detect the specific `pytest.mark.repeat` attribute access pattern
- Comprehensive test coverage validates all expected behavior and edge cases

## Bonus Fix

Fixed a pre-existing bug in the JSON output format where `Violation.json()` was accessing non-existent attributes (`self.lineno` instead of `self.loc.lineno`).

## Testing

- Created comprehensive test suite covering various decorator patterns
- Verified no false positives on other pytest decorators
- Confirmed rule only applies to test files
- Validated existing linter functionality remains intact

Fixes #16087.

3120603357,16093,[BUG] ERROR mlflow.server: Exception on /graphql when trying to open a run if auth is enabled,"- [x] Identify the root cause of the TypeError in GraphQL endpoint when auth is enabled
- [x] Understand how Flask endpoints are registered and how auth after_request handlers work
- [x] Implement fix in get_endpoints() function to handle GraphQL endpoint properly for after_request handlers
- [x] Create test to verify the fix works correctly - test_graphql_with_auth added to test_auth.py  
- [x] Test the solution logic manually to confirm it handles both normal and auth scenarios correctly
- [x] Verify minimal code changes and syntax correctness

**Summary:** Fixed TypeError that occurred when accessing GraphQL endpoint with auth enabled. The issue was that `_after_request` hook was calling `_graphql(resp)` with a response argument, but `_graphql()` takes no arguments.

**Root Cause:** The GraphQL endpoint was hardcoded in `get_endpoints()` and didn't respect the `get_handler` parameter used by auth module to register after-request handlers.

**Solution:** Modified `get_endpoints()` to check the handler function name:
- Normal case: `get_handler.__name__ == ""get_handler""` → uses `_graphql` 
- Auth case: other handler functions (like `get_after_request_handler`) → calls `get_handler(None)` which returns `None`

When handler is `None`, the auth module's `_after_request` doesn't call it, preventing the TypeError.

**Changes:** 
- 12 lines added, 1 removed in `mlflow/server/handlers.py` (mostly comments + 9 lines of logic)
- 38 lines added for comprehensive test `test_graphql_with_auth`

**Testing:** Logic verified manually and comprehensive test added to ensure GraphQL works correctly with authentication enabled.

Fixes #16071.

3103408529,15978,Add rule to enforce GitHub Actions pinned by full commit SHA,"## Summary

This PR adds a new rule to `.github/policy.rego` that enforces GitHub Actions to be pinned by their full commit SHA rather than using tags or branch names.

## Implementation details

The rule works by:
1. Checking all GitHub Actions used in workflow files
2. Verifying they use a full 40-character hexadecimal SHA (e.g., `actions/checkout@11bd71901bbe5b1630ceea73d27597364c9af683`)
3. Excluding local actions (those starting with `./`)

For example:
```yaml
# Bad (will be caught by the rule)
- uses: actions/checkout@v4

# Good (will pass the rule)
- uses: actions/checkout@11bd71901bbe5b1630ceea73d27597364c9af683 # v4.2.2

# Exception (will pass the rule)
- uses: ./.github/actions/setup-python
```

## Security benefits

Pinning actions by full commit SHA helps:
- Prevent supply chain attacks
- Ensure reproducible workflows
- Avoid unexpected changes when action maintainers update tags

Fixes #15977.

3232438793,6035,Move IDataConsumer from Microsoft.Testing.Platform.Extensions.TestHost to Microsoft.Testing.Platform.Extensions namespace,"The `IDataConsumer` interface was previously located in the `Microsoft.Testing.Platform.Extensions.TestHost` namespace and inherited from `ITestHostExtension`, which limited its usage to TestHost-specific implementations. Since `IDataConsumer` can be implemented in other hosts as well, this PR moves it to the root `Microsoft.Testing.Platform.Extensions` namespace.

## Changes Made

### 1. Interface Location and Inheritance
- **Moved** `IDataConsumer.cs` from `src/Platform/Microsoft.Testing.Platform/Messages/` to `src/Platform/Microsoft.Testing.Platform/Extensions/`
- **Updated namespace** from `Microsoft.Testing.Platform.Extensions.TestHost` to `Microsoft.Testing.Platform.Extensions`
- **Changed inheritance** from `ITestHostExtension` to `IExtension` to make it available for other hosts

### 2. Updated References
Updated all source files, test files, and sample files to use the new namespace:
- Added `using Microsoft.Testing.Platform.Extensions;` statements where needed
- Updated 30 files across the codebase including:
  - Core platform files (22 files)
  - Test files (4 files) 
  - Sample files (3 files)
  - PublicAPI.Shipped.txt (1 file)

### 3. Public API Changes
Updated `PublicAPI.Shipped.txt` to reflect the new namespace:
```diff
- Microsoft.Testing.Platform.Extensions.TestHost.IDataConsumer
+ Microsoft.Testing.Platform.Extensions.IDataConsumer
```

## Benefits

- **Broader Usage**: `IDataConsumer` can now be implemented in any host type, not just TestHost
- **Better Organization**: Interface is now in the root Extensions namespace alongside other general extension interfaces
- **Consistent Design**: Aligns with the principle that extensions should be host-agnostic when possible

## Breaking Changes

This is a breaking change for consumers who directly reference the old namespace. However, the interface contract and functionality remain identical - only the namespace import needs to be updated.

Fixes #3354.

3174268903,10035,Add dot notation support for aspire config commands,"## Summary

Enhances the `aspire config set`, `get`, and `delete` commands to support dot notation for creating and managing nested JSON configuration structures.

## Changes

### Before
```bash
aspire config set foo.bar baz
# Created: { ""foo.bar"": ""baz"" }  # Flat key with literal dots
```

### After  
```bash
aspire config set foo.bar baz
# Creates: { ""foo"": { ""bar"": ""baz"" } }  # Nested object structure
```

## Key Features

- **Nested object creation**: `aspire config set foo.bar.baz hello` creates `{ ""foo"": { ""bar"": { ""baz"": ""hello"" } } }`
- **Primitive replacement**: Setting `foo.bar` after `foo` exists as a string automatically converts it to an object
- **Smart cleanup**: Deleting nested values removes empty parent objects automatically
- **Backward compatibility**: Existing flat keys continue to work unchanged
- **Proper retrieval**: `aspire config get foo.bar.baz` correctly navigates nested structures
- **Flattened listing**: `aspire config list` shows nested keys with dot notation (e.g., `foo.bar.baz=hello`)

## Implementation Details

### ConfigurationService Enhancements
- `SetNestedValue()`: Parses dot-separated keys and creates nested JSON objects
- `DeleteNestedValue()`: Removes values and cleans up empty parent objects  
- `GetNestedValue()`: Traverses nested paths for value retrieval
- `FlattenJsonObject()`: Recursively flattens JSON for list operations
- `GetConfigurationAsync()`: New method for single key lookups with dot notation support

### Updated Commands
- **GetCommand**: Now uses `ConfigurationService.GetConfigurationAsync()` instead of flat `IConfiguration` lookup
- **SetCommand**: Automatically handles nested object creation and primitive replacement
- **DeleteCommand**: Includes smart cleanup of empty parent objects
- **ListCommand**: Displays all keys in flattened dot notation format

## Examples

```bash
# Set nested values
aspire config set database.host localhost
aspire config set database.port 5432
aspire config set logging.level debug

# Results in:
{
  ""database"": {
    ""host"": ""localhost"", 
    ""port"": ""5432""
  },
  ""logging"": {
    ""level"": ""debug""
  }
}

# Retrieve nested values
aspire config get database.host    # Returns: localhost
aspire config get logging.level    # Returns: debug

# List shows flattened view
aspire config list
# Output:
# database.host=localhost
# database.port=5432
# logging.level=debug

# Delete with automatic cleanup
aspire config delete database.port
aspire config delete database.host
# The entire ""database"" object is removed since it becomes empty
```

## Testing

- **81 tests pass** including comprehensive new test suite
- Tests cover all scenarios: nested creation, primitive replacement, deletion cleanup, error handling
- Backward compatibility verified - all existing flat key functionality preserved
- Manual testing confirms real-world usage works as expected

## Breaking Changes

None. This is a fully backward-compatible enhancement. Existing configurations and usage patterns continue to work unchanged.

3190291382,10155,Remove deployCommandEnabled feature flag from Aspire CLI,"This PR removes all references to the `deployCommandEnabled` feature flag from the Aspire CLI codebase, making the deploy command always available.

## Changes Made

### Core Changes
- **`src/Aspire.Cli/KnownFeatures.cs`**: Removed the `DeployCommandEnabled` property definition
- **`src/Aspire.Cli/Commands/RootCommand.cs`**: Removed conditional logic that checked the feature flag before adding the deploy command. The deploy command is now always added to the subcommands collection.

### Test Updates
- **`tests/Aspire.Cli.Tests/Commands/DeployCommandTests.cs`**: Removed all `options.EnabledFeatures = new[] { KnownFeatures.DeployCommandEnabled }` statements since the feature flag no longer exists
- **`tests/Aspire.Cli.Tests/Commands/ConfigCommandTests.cs`**: 
  - Removed feature flag-specific tests (`FeatureFlags_WhenSetToTrue_ReturnsTrue`, `FeatureFlags_WhenSetToFalse_ReturnsFalse`, `FeatureFlags_WhenSetToInvalidValue_ReturnsFalse`)
  - Removed deploy command availability tests that depended on feature flags (`DeployCommand_WhenFeatureFlagDisabled_IsNotAvailable`, `DeployCommand_WhenFeatureFlagEnabled_IsAvailable`)
  - Added new test `DeployCommand_IsAlwaysAvailable` to verify the deploy command is always present
  - Removed unused `using Aspire.Cli.Configuration;` directive

## Verification

✅ All existing CLI tests pass  
✅ Full repository build succeeds  
✅ Deploy command is visible in `aspire --help` output  
✅ Deploy command help works: `aspire deploy --help`  

## Impact

This change removes the experimental nature of the deploy command and makes it a stable, always-available feature of the Aspire CLI. Users no longer need to enable a feature flag to access deployment functionality.

3230973688,10411,Fix TryMatchAgainstResources to return false for multiple resource matches,"## Problem

The `TryMatchAgainstResources` method in `ResourceOutgoingPeerResolver` was returning `true` on the first resource match, even when multiple resources had matching addresses. This could lead to ambiguous peer resolution where the method would return different results depending on the order of resources in the collection.

## Solution

Updated `TryMatchAgainstResources` to:
- Count all matching resources before returning a result
- Return `true` only if exactly one resource matches
- Return `false` if zero or multiple resources match (ambiguous case)
- Set out parameters to `null` when returning `false` for multiple matches

## Changes

### Core Logic Update
```csharp
// Before: returned immediately on first match
if (DoesAddressMatch(resourceAddress, peerAddress))
{
    name = ResourceViewModel.GetResourceName(resource, resources);
    resourceMatch = resource;
    return true; // ← Problem: returned without checking for other matches
}

// After: counts all matches before deciding
if (DoesAddressMatch(resourceAddress, peerAddress))
{
    if (foundResource is null)
    {
        foundResource = resource;
    }
    matchCount++;
    break; // No need to check other addresses for this resource
}
// Returns true only if matchCount == 1
```

### Comprehensive Test Coverage

Added unit tests covering realistic scenarios:

- **SQL Server addresses**: Multiple resources with `localhost:1433` addresses
- **Redis addresses**: Multiple resources with `localhost:6379` addresses  
- **SQL Server comma format**: Resources matching `localhost,1433` format
- **Mixed port formats**: Resources with same logical address but different formats
- **Address transformation**: Scenarios showing how `127.0.0.1` ↔ `localhost` transformations work
- **Single match validation**: Ensuring positive cases still work correctly

## Test Results

- ✅ All 24 ResourceOutgoingPeerResolver tests passing (17 existing + 7 new)
- ✅ All 269 Dashboard tests passing (verified no regressions)
- ✅ Covers realistic SQL Server and Redis endpoint scenarios

## Files Changed

- `src/Aspire.Dashboard/Model/ResourceOutgoingPeerResolver.cs` - Updated core matching logic
- `tests/Aspire.Dashboard.Tests/ResourceOutgoingPeerResolverTests.cs` - Added comprehensive test scenarios

This fix ensures deterministic peer resolution behavior and prevents ambiguous matches from returning inconsistent results.

*This pull request was created as a result of the following prompt from Copilot chat.*
> Update TryMatchAgainstResources to return false if multiple resources match, and update/add tests with realistic addresses. Only return true if exactly one match is found. If more than one resource matches, set out parameters to null and return false. Update or add unit tests in Aspire.Dashboard.Tests to cover: (1) no match, (2) single match, (3) multiple matches (ambiguous), using realistic resource addresses like SQL and Redis endpoints.

3195886974,10209,Add user-friendly message when AddCommand search returns no results,"## Problem

When running `aspire add [foo]` in the Aspire CLI, if the user mistypes the package name and no packages match, the CLI currently falls back to displaying the full list of packages without explaining why. Users may be confused as to why they are seeing every package instead of just their search term.

## Solution

This PR adds a user-friendly message that explains when no packages matched the search term and that all packages are being shown instead.

**Before:**
```bash
$ aspire add nonexistentpackage
Searching for Aspire packages...
Select an integration to add:  # Shows all packages without explanation
```

**After:**
```bash
$ aspire add nonexistentpackage
Searching for Aspire packages...
No packages matched your search term 'nonexistentpackage'. Showing all available packages.
Select an integration to add:  # Now users understand why they see all packages
```

## Changes Made

- **Added new localizable string** `NoPackagesMatchedSearchTerm` to `AddCommandStrings.resx` with format placeholder for the search term
- **Modified AddCommand logic** to detect when no packages match the user's search term and display an informational message before showing the full package list
- **Added helper method** `GetPackageByInteractiveFlowWithNoMatchesMessage` that displays the message using `DisplaySubtleMessage()` only when a search term was provided
- **Enhanced test coverage** with `AddCommand_NoMatchingPackages_DisplaysNoMatchesMessage` test that verifies the message is displayed correctly
- **Extended test infrastructure** by adding `DisplaySubtleMessageCallback` to `TestConsoleInteractionService`

## Key Features

- **Minimal impact**: Only shows the message when there are truly no matches and a search term was provided
- **Localizable**: Uses the existing resource string infrastructure for internationalization
- **Non-breaking**: Existing behavior is preserved, just with additional helpful context
- **Well-tested**: Comprehensive test coverage ensures the feature works correctly and doesn't break existing functionality

The implementation follows existing patterns in the codebase and maintains backward compatibility while significantly improving the user experience.

Changes made:
- Changed the class declaration from `public class RpcResourceState` to `internal class RpcResourceState` in `src/Aspire.Cli/Backchannel/RpcResourceState.cs`
- Changed the class declaration from `public class RpcResourceState` to `internal class RpcResourceState` in `src/Aspire.Hosting/Backchannel/RpcResourceState.cs`

These are intentionally minimal changes since the class is only used internally within both packages. The changes don't affect any public API behavior, and all tests continue to pass.

3180198385,10077,Fix output when publish completes with warning,"Currently, when a `publish` command completes with a warning, the CLI displays:

```
✅ PUBLISHING COMPLETED: Publishing completed with warnings
```

This is misleading because it shows a green checkmark for a completion state that has warnings. 

This PR fixes the issue to correctly display:

```
⚠  PUBLISHING COMPLETED: Publishing completed with warnings
```

**Changes made:**
- Updated `ProcessAndDisplayPublishingActivitiesAsync` in `PublishCommandBase.cs` to handle three completion states:
  - Error: Shows red ❌ PUBLISHING FAILED
  - Warning: Shows yellow ⚠ PUBLISHING COMPLETED (this was the fix)
  - Success: Shows green ✅ PUBLISHING COMPLETED

- Added unit tests in `PublishCommandBaseTests.cs` to validate the behavior for all three completion states

The fix is minimal and surgical - it only adds a check for warnings using the existing `IsCompletionStateWarning` helper method and displays the appropriate yellow warning symbol with yellow text color instead of the green checkmark when publishing completes with warnings.

Fixes #10076.

## Summary

This PR implements a new linting rule `ThreadPoolExecutorWithoutThreadNamePrefix` (MLF0025) in the clint tool to enforce that `ThreadPoolExecutor` instances are created with a `thread_name_prefix` argument for better debugging and traceability.

## Problem

Currently, there's no automated check to ensure `ThreadPoolExecutor` instances use proper thread naming. This leads to inconsistent practices and makes debugging thread-related issues more difficult. Without named threads:
- It's hard to identify which threads belong to which component during debugging
- Thread dumps and logs become less informative
- Performance monitoring and profiling are harder to interpret

## Solution

Added a new linting rule that:
- Detects `ThreadPoolExecutor()` and `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor()` usage
- Requires `thread_name_prefix` keyword argument to be present
- Excludes `tests/` and `examples/` directories (consistent with existing `UnnamedThread` rule)
- Provides clear error messages for violations

### Examples

**❌ Bad (triggers the rule):**
```python
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor
executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=4)
```

**✅ Good (passes the rule):**
```python
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor
executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(
    max_workers=4,
    thread_name_prefix=""MyComponent""
)
```

## Current State

The rule identified 5 existing violations across 4 files:
- `mlflow/metrics/genai/genai_metric.py`: 2 violations
- `mlflow/tracing/client.py`: 1 violation  
- `mlflow/langchain/api_request_parallel_processor.py`: 1 violation
- `mlflow/openai/api_request_parallel_processor.py`: 1 violation

Files like `mlflow/tracing/export/async_export_queue.py` and `mlflow/spark/autologging.py` already follow best practices with proper thread naming.

## Implementation Details

- **`dev/clint/src/clint/rules.py`**: Added `ThreadPoolExecutorWithoutThreadNamePrefix` rule class (19 lines)
- **`dev/clint/src/clint/linter.py`**: Added rule check in `visit_Call` method with proper exclusions (6 lines)

The implementation follows the same pattern as the existing `UnnamedThread` rule and integrates seamlessly with the current clint infrastructure.

Fixes #16310.

3156695913,5815,Obsolete Assert.Equals and add obsolete Assert.ReferenceEquals,"Changes `Assert.Equals` from throwing an exception to being marked as obsolete, and adds a new obsolete `Assert.ReferenceEquals` method. This prevents silent failures that would occur if these methods were removed entirely.

## Problem

The original plan was to remove `Assert.Equals` in v4, but this would create a dangerous scenario:

```csharp
// If Assert.Equals is removed, this code would silently call object.Equals()
// and never actually assert anything - a silent test failure!
Assert.Equals(expected, actual); // Falls back to object.Equals() - no assertion!
```

## Solution

Instead of removal, both methods are now marked with `[Obsolete]` attributes:

- **`Assert.Equals`**: Now obsolete instead of throwing `Assert.Fail()`
- **`Assert.ReferenceEquals`**: New obsolete method to prevent similar issues

Both methods consistently return `false` and guide users to proper alternatives:
- `Assert.Equals` → Use `Assert.AreEqual` and overloads
- `Assert.ReferenceEquals` → Use `Assert.AreSame` and overloads

## Implementation Details

- ✅ Modified `Assert.Equals` with `[Obsolete]` attribute
- ✅ Added new `Assert.ReferenceEquals` with `[Obsolete]` attribute  
- ✅ Added `DoNotUseAssertReferenceEquals` resource string with full localization (13 languages)
- ✅ Updated `PublicAPI.Unshipped.txt` for new method
- ✅ Added unit tests to verify obsolete behavior
- ✅ Updated XML documentation

## Testing

```csharp
#pragma warning disable CS0618 // Type or member is obsolete
bool result1 = Assert.Equals(""test"", ""test"");        // Returns false, shows obsolete warning
bool result2 = Assert.ReferenceEquals(obj, obj);     // Returns false, shows obsolete warning  
#pragma warning restore CS0618 // Type or member is obsolete
```

This approach provides compile-time warnings while preventing the dangerous silent failure scenario.

Fixes #5758.

This PR implements a new lint rule in MLflow's custom linter (clint) to prevent the creation of unnamed `threading.Thread` instances, which makes debugging and monitoring significantly more difficult.

## Problem

When creating threads without explicit names using `threading.Thread()`, Python assigns generic names like ""Thread-1"", ""Thread-2"", etc. This creates several issues:

1. **Debugging Difficulty**: Stack traces and logs show generic thread names, making it hard to identify which part of the code spawned a problematic thread
2. **Monitoring Challenges**: Thread monitoring tools cannot provide meaningful insights when all threads have generic names
3. **Code Maintainability**: Developers cannot easily understand the purpose of threads when reviewing code or investigating issues

## Solution

The new rule **MLF0024** detects `threading.Thread()` calls that don't include a `name` parameter and suggests adding one for easier debugging.

### Examples

**Bad (flagged by MLF0024):**
```python
import threading

# Unnamed thread - difficult to debug
thread = threading.Thread(target=my_function)

# Also bad - using args but no name
thread = threading.Thread(target=my_function, args=(arg1, arg2))
```

**Good (passes MLF0024):**
```python
import threading

# Named thread - easy to identify in debugging
thread = threading.Thread(target=my_function, name=""data_processor"")

# Also good - using keyword args with name
thread = threading.Thread(target=my_function, args=(arg1, arg2), name=""background_worker"")
```

## Implementation Details

- **Rule ID**: MLF0024
- **Rule Name**: `unnamed-thread`
- **Detection**: Focuses on `threading.Thread()` pattern to avoid false positives with other classes named `Thread`
- **Disable Support**: Can be disabled with `# clint: disable=unnamed-thread` comments
- **Integration**: Added to the existing `visit_Call()` method in the linter

## Testing

The implementation has been thoroughly tested with:
- ✅ Correctly identifies unnamed `threading.Thread()` calls
- ✅ Ignores properly named threads
- ✅ Respects disable comments
- ✅ Avoids false positives with other `Thread` classes
- ✅ Works with existing MLflow codebase
- ✅ Passes all pre-commit hooks including clint itself

Fixes #16230.

3093399248,5650,Fix async void analyzer to detect StringAssert and CollectionAssert,"Currently, the AvoidUsingAssertsInAsyncVoidContextAnalyzer only detects uses of the Assert class in async void methods, but it doesn't detect uses of StringAssert and CollectionAssert. This can lead to missing warnings when assertions from these classes are used in async void contexts, which can cause the same issues (missed test failures).

This PR extends the analyzer to detect all three assertion classes:

### Changes:

1. **Modified the Initialize method:**
   - Now fetches symbols for StringAssert and CollectionAssert in addition to Assert
   - Registers the operation action if any of the three symbols is available

2. **Updated the AnalyzeOperation method:**
   - Changed the method signature to accept all three assert type symbols
   - Implemented a check that verifies if the invocation's target method's containing type matches any of the three assert types

3. **Added test cases:**
   - Tests for StringAssert in async void methods, local functions, and delegates
   - Tests for CollectionAssert in async void methods, local functions, and delegates

With these changes, the analyzer now correctly flags all assertion methods (from Assert, StringAssert, and CollectionAssert) when used in async void contexts, providing more comprehensive detection of potential issues.

Fixes #5649.

3267135504,6190,Add analyzer to flag Assert.Throws with multiple statements (MSTEST0051),"This PR implements a new analyzer `AssertThrowsShouldContainSingleStatementAnalyzer` (MSTEST0050) that flags problematic patterns where `Assert.Throws` methods contain multiple statements in their lambda expressions.

## Problem

Patterns like this are misleading and similar to issues with `ExpectedExceptionAttribute`:

```csharp
Assert.Throws<Exception>(() =>
{
    Call1();
    Call2();
});
```

The issue is that it's unclear which statement is expected to throw:
- If `Call1()` throws, then `Call2()` is redundant and never executed
- If `Call1()` doesn't throw, it should be moved outside the `Assert.Throws`

## Solution

The new analyzer detects and flags these patterns across all Assert.Throws variants:
- `Assert.Throws<T>()`
- `Assert.ThrowsExactly<T>()`
- `Assert.ThrowsAsync<T>()`
- `Assert.ThrowsExactlyAsync<T>()`

### Examples

**❌ Flagged patterns:**
```csharp
Assert.Throws<Exception>(() =>
{
    var setup = GetSetup();
    setup.DoSomething(); // MSTEST0050: Multiple statements detected
});
```

**✅ Accepted patterns:**
```csharp
// Single expression - good
Assert.Throws<Exception>(() => DoSomething());

// Single statement in block - good
Assert.Throws<Exception>(() => { DoSomething(); });

// Setup moved outside - good
var setup = GetSetup();
Assert.Throws<Exception>(() => setup.DoSomething());
```

## Implementation Details

- **Rule ID**: MSTEST0050
- **Category**: Usage  
- **Severity**: Warning
- Uses operation analysis to examine lambda bodies
- Counts meaningful statements (ignoring empty and implicit return statements)
- Includes comprehensive test coverage and localization support for all languages

Fixes #6188.

3235274361,10454,Remove PingAsync RPC method from backchannel interfaces and implementations,"This PR removes the `PingAsync` RPC method from both the AppHost and Extension backchannel interfaces and their implementations as requested in the issue.

## Changes Made

### Interface and Implementation Updates
- **`IAppHostBackchannel`**: Removed `PingAsync` method definition
- **`AppHostBackchannel`**: Removed `PingAsync` implementation 
- **`IExtensionBackchannel`**: Removed `PingAsync` method definition
- **`ExtensionBackchannel`**: Removed `PingAsync` implementation
- **`AppHostRpcTarget`**: Removed `PingAsync` RPC target method

### Test Updates
- **`TestAppHostBackchannel`**: Removed ping-related properties and implementation
- **`PublishCommandPromptingIntegrationTests`**: Removed `PingAsync` from `TestPromptBackchannel`
- **`AppHostBackchannelTests`**: Removed the `CanRespondToPingAsync` test

## Files Modified
- `src/Aspire.Hosting/Backchannel/AppHostRpcTarget.cs`
- `src/Aspire.Cli/Backchannel/AppHostBackchannel.cs`
- `src/Aspire.Cli/Backchannel/ExtensionBackchannel.cs`

3267970992,10691,Remove duplicate startup logging from DashboardLifecycleHook,"The dashboard startup messages ""Now listening on"" and ""Login to the dashboard at"" were being logged twice in Aspire 9.4, creating duplicate console output as shown in the issue screenshots.

## Root Cause

Both `DashboardLifecycleHook` and `DashboardWebApplication` were independently logging the same startup information:

1. `DashboardLifecycleHook` logged these messages in two places:
   - The `ResourceReadyEvent` handler
   - The `ConfigureEnvironmentVariables` method
2. `DashboardWebApplication` also logs the same messages during its startup lifecycle

This resulted in duplicate log entries for each startup message.

## Solution

Removed the duplicate logging calls from `DashboardLifecycleHook.cs` while preserving all other functionality:

- Simplified the `ResourceReadyEvent` handler to only return `Task.CompletedTask`
- Removed the logging code from the `ConfigureEnvironmentVariables` method that was duplicating the dashboard's own startup logs

The `DashboardWebApplication` continues to handle startup logging correctly, ensuring users still see the necessary ""Now listening on"" and login URL information, but only once per message.

## Before/After

**Before (duplicate logs):**
```
info: Aspire.Hosting.DistributedApplication[0]
      Now listening on: https://localhost:17225
info: Aspire.Hosting.DistributedApplication[0]
      Login to the dashboard at https://localhost:17225/login?t=...
info: Aspire.Hosting.DistributedApplication[0]  
      Now listening on: https://localhost:17225
info: Aspire.Hosting.DistributedApplication[0]
      Login to the dashboard at https://localhost:17225/login?t=...
```

**After (clean single logs):**
```
info: Aspire.Hosting.DistributedApplication[0]
      Now listening on: https://localhost:17225
info: Aspire.Hosting.DistributedApplication[0]
      Login to the dashboard at https://localhost:17225/login?t=...

3269921592,10700,"aspire config set writes appHostPath to ~/.aspire/settings.json globally, causing incorrect path resolution","Analyzing and fixing the issue where `aspire config set` writes `appHostPath` to global settings file instead of local project settings.

## Analysis

The issue occurs in the `ConfigurationService.FindNearestSettingsFile()` method. When `aspire run` tries to create local settings with the `appHostPath`, the method walks up the directory tree looking for existing settings files. If the user's project is under their home directory, this search can find the global `~/.aspire/settings.json` file and treat it as a ""local"" settings file, causing the `appHostPath` to be written globally instead of locally.

## Plan

- [x] Analyze the issue and identify root cause in `ConfigurationService.FindNearestSettingsFile()`
- [ ] Create focused test to reproduce the issue
- [ ] Implement fix to prevent global settings file from being considered as local
- [ ] Test the fix works correctly
- [ ] Run existing tests to ensure no regressions

Fixes #10699.

3075036713,9400,Add health column to Aspire CLI resources table,"This PR adds a health status column to the Aspire CLI resources table when running an Aspire app with the `aspire run` command.

## Changes

1. Modified `AppHostRpcTarget.GetResourceStatesAsync` to include health status in the returned tuple:
   - Added a new `string? Health` field to the tuple
   - Used the existing `ComputeHealthStatus` method to get the health value

2. Updated the `IAppHostBackchannel` interface and `AppHostBackchannel` implementation on the CLI side to handle the new health status field

3. Added a new ""Health"" column to the resources table in `RunCommand.cs`:
   - Updated the column definitions to include a ""Health"" column
   - Added rendering for health status with appropriate colors (similar to how state is displayed)
   - Added styling for health status values:
     * Healthy = green
     * Degraded = yellow
     * Unhealthy = red
     * Unknown/null = grey

These changes leverage the health status information that is already being computed in the `ResourceSnapshot` class, making it visible in the CLI interface consistent with how it's shown in the Dashboard UI.

## Result

Before this PR, the resources table looked like:
```
┌────────────┬────────┬─────────┬────────────┐
│ Resource   │ Type   │ State   │ Endpoint(s)│
├────────────┼────────┼─────────┼────────────┤
│ ...        │ ...    │ ...     │ ...        │
└────────────┴────────┴─────────┴────────────┘
```

After this PR, the resources table will look like:
```
┌────────────┬────────┬─────────┬─────────┬────────────┐
│ Resource   │ Type   │ State   │ Health  │ Endpoint(s)│
├────────────┼────────┼─────────┼─────────┼────────────┤
│ ...        │ ...    │ ...     │ Healthy │ ...        │
└────────────┴────────┴─────────┴─────────┴────────────┘
```

3184732857,10108,Fix usability issues with IPublishingActivityProgressReporter,"This PR addresses three usability issues with the `IPublishingActivityProgressReporter` interface:

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Steps with no tasks incorrectly reported as InProgress
Previously, `CalculateAggregatedState()` would return `CompletionState.InProgress` for steps that had no tasks, when it should return `CompletionState.Completed`:

```csharp
// Before (incorrect)
if (_tasks.IsEmpty)
{
    return CompletionState.InProgress;  // Wrong!
}

// After (correct)
if (_tasks.IsEmpty)
{
    return CompletionState.Completed;   // Correct!
}
```

### 2. CLI rendering didn't handle warning states for steps
The CLI only checked for error vs non-error states when rendering step completion, ignoring warning states. Now it properly handles warnings similar to how tasks are rendered:

```csharp
// Before - only error/success
if (IsCompletionStateError(stepInfo.CompletionState))
{
    AnsiConsole.MarkupLine($""[red bold]❌ FAILED:[/] {stepInfo.CompletionText.EscapeMarkup()}"");
}
else
{
    AnsiConsole.MarkupLine($""[green bold]✅ COMPLETED:[/] {stepInfo.CompletionText.EscapeMarkup()}"");
}

// After - handles error/warning/success
if (IsCompletionStateError(stepInfo.CompletionState))
{
    AnsiConsole.MarkupLine($""[red bold]❌ FAILED:[/] {stepInfo.CompletionText.EscapeMarkup()}"");
}
else if (IsCompletionStateWarning(stepInfo.CompletionState))
{
    AnsiConsole.MarkupLine($""[yellow bold]⚠ WARNING:[/] {stepInfo.CompletionText.EscapeMarkup()}"");
}
else
{
    AnsiConsole.MarkupLine($""[green bold]✅ COMPLETED:[/] {stepInfo.CompletionText.EscapeMarkup()}"");
}
```

### 3. Steps without tasks could render completion twice
`DisposeAsync()` would always call `CompleteStepAsync()`, even if the step was already completed, potentially causing duplicate completion rendering. Now it checks if the step is already completed:

```csharp
// Added guard to prevent double completion
if (CompletionState != CompletionState.InProgress)
{
    return;
}
```

## Tests Added
- `CalculateAggregatedState_WithNoTasks_ReturnsCompleted`
- `DisposeAsync_StepWithNoTasks_CompletesWithSuccessState`
- `DisposeAsync_StepWithCompletedTasks_CompletesWithSuccessState`
- `DisposeAsync_StepWithWarningTasks_CompletesWithWarningState`
- `DisposeAsync_StepAlreadyCompleted_DoesNotCompleteAgain`

All existing tests continue to pass, ensuring no breaking changes.

Fixes #10107.

3251731325,6123,Fix MSTEST0037 codefix to preserve message arguments in collection count transformations,"The MSTEST0037 codefix was dropping message arguments when transforming collection count assertions. Consider:

```csharp
// Before (drops message argument):
Assert.AreEqual(2, myCollection.Count, ""Wrong number of elements"");
// Was transformed to:
Assert.HasCount(2, myCollection);

// After this fix (preserves message argument):
Assert.AreEqual(2, myCollection.Count, ""Wrong number of elements"");
// Is correctly transformed to:
Assert.HasCount(2, myCollection, ""Wrong number of elements"");
```

**Root Cause:**
The `FixAssertMethodForCollectionCountModeAsync` method in `UseProperAssertMethodsFixer` was creating a new argument list with only the required arguments (count and collection) but ignoring any additional arguments beyond the first two from the original invocation.

**Solution:**
- Modified the codefix to preserve additional arguments using `argumentList.Arguments.Skip(2).ToList()`
- Enhanced both `IsEmpty` and `HasCount` transformation paths to append preserved arguments
- Added comprehensive test coverage for message argument preservation

**Changes:**
- Fixed argument preservation in `UseProperAssertMethodsFixer.cs`
- Added three test cases covering different scenarios:
  - Basic message preservation for HasCount
  - Message preservation for IsEmpty transformations  
  - Multiple parameter preservation

The fix ensures that all transformations now correctly preserve message arguments and other additional parameters that were previously being dropped.

Fixes #6121.

3078712434,9437,[CI] Change AzDO public pipeline to run weekly instead of per-commit,"This PR changes the Azure DevOps public pipeline to run on a weekly schedule rather than on every commit to the main branch, as requested in the issue.

## Changes

- Modified `eng/pipelines/azure-pipelines-public.yml` to:
  - Replace the continuous integration trigger with a scheduled trigger
  - Configure the pipeline to run at midnight (UTC) every Monday
  - Set `always: true` to ensure the build runs weekly regardless of code changes
  - Set `trigger: none` to explicitly disable continuous integration triggers

## Benefits

- Reduces CI resource usage as we now have regular rolling builds on GitHub Actions
- Maintains the same branch filtering from the original configuration
- Preserves PR validation to continue testing pull requests

The pipeline will continue to build the same branches (main and release/*) but on a weekly cadence instead of for every commit.

## Description

The `validate-author` GitHub Action currently validates permissions for users who comment on PRs, but it doesn't allow the `mlflow-app[bot]` user to trigger workflows. This PR updates the action to include `mlflow-app[bot]` in the list of allowed bot users.

## Problem

The current `isAllowed` function in `.github/actions/validate-author/index.js` only allows:
- Users with `owner`, `member`, or `collaborator` repository permissions
- The `copilot` bot user

However, it doesn't include the `mlflow-app[bot]` user, which is already used for automated tasks in workflows like autoformat.yml.

## Solution

Updated the `isAllowed` function to include `mlflow-app[bot]` in the list of allowed bot users:

**Before:**
```javascript
(user && user.login.toLowerCase() === ""copilot"" && user.type.toLowerCase() === ""bot"")
```

**After:**
```javascript
(user &&
  user.type.toLowerCase() === ""bot"" &&
  [""copilot"", ""mlflow-app[bot]""].includes(user.login.toLowerCase()))
```

## Changes Made

- ✅ Updated the `isAllowed` function to allow `mlflow-app[bot]` user
- ✅ Improved code maintainability by using an array for multiple allowed bot users
- ✅ Updated comment to reflect both allowed bots
- ✅ Applied prettier formatting for consistency

## Testing

Created comprehensive tests covering:
- Repository permissions (owner, member, collaborator)
- Bot permissions (copilot, mlflow-app[bot], and other bots)
- Case sensitivity handling

3135573640,9814,Fix CLI to automatically fallback when apphost file in settings doesn't exist,"## Problem

Currently, when `aspire run` is executed, the CLI looks for an apphost, stores its path in `.aspire/settings.json`, and uses this path on subsequent runs. If the apphost is deleted or renamed, the CLI errors and requires the user to manually edit the settings file:

```
AppHost file was specified in '/path/to/.aspire/settings.json' but it does not exist.
```

## Solution

This PR implements automatic fallback behavior when the apphost path in the settings file is invalid. Instead of throwing an exception, the CLI now automatically scans for projects again, allowing the settings file to be ""healed"" without user intervention.

## Changes

**Modified `GetAppHostProjectFileFromSettingsAsync` in `ProjectLocator.cs`:**
- Changed behavior to return `null` instead of throwing when the specified apphost file doesn't exist
- This triggers the existing fallback logic that scans for available apphost projects
- After finding a valid project, the settings file is automatically updated with the new path

**Added test coverage:**
- New test `UseOrFindAppHostProjectFileFallsBackWhenSettingsFileSpecifiesNonexistentAppHost` verifies the fallback behavior
- Test creates a scenario where settings.json points to a non-existent file and confirms the system falls back to scanning

## Before/After Behavior

**Before:**
```bash
$ aspire run
# Error: AppHost file was specified in '.aspire/settings.json' but it does not exist.
# User must manually edit or delete settings.json
```

**After:**
```bash
$ aspire run
# Automatically scans for apphost projects when the stored path is invalid
# Finds available projects and updates settings.json with the new selection
# Continues execution seamlessly
```

## Impact

- **Non-breaking**: Existing functionality remains unchanged when apphost files exist
- **User-friendly**: Eliminates the need for manual settings file editing
- **Minimal**: Only 3 lines of implementation code changed
- **Well-tested**: Comprehensive test coverage ensures the fallback works correctly

This change improves the developer experience by making the CLI more resilient to common scenarios like project restructuring or file cleanup.",Copilot,198982749,Copilot,closed,2025-06-11T05:52:37Z,2025-06-11T09:22:53Z,2025-06-11T09:22:53Z,696529789.0,https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/aspire,https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/pull/9814,agent,696529789.0,https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/aspire,MIT,dotnet/aspire,C#,659.0,4723.0
3135618364,9815,Fix user secrets duplication issue by normalizing to flat configuration format,"## Problem

Azure auto-provisioning was creating duplicate user secrets entries in both flat and nested JSON formats, leading to configuration conflicts. For example:

```json
{
  ""Azure:SubscriptionId"": ""07268dd7-4c50-434b-b1ff-67b8164edb41"",
  ""Azure:Tenant"": ""microsoft.onmicrosoft.com"",
  ""Azure:Location"": ""eastus2"",
  ""Azure"": {
    ""Tenant"": ""microsoft.onmicrosoft.com"",
    ""Deployments"": {
      ""MyStorage"": {
        ""Id"": ""/subscriptions/07268dd7-4c50-434b-b1ff-67b8164edb41/resourceGroups/rg-aspire/providers/Microsoft.Resources/deployments/MyStorage"",
        ""Parameters"": ""{\""principalId\"":{\""value\"":\""e2c0aecb-0cc9-412c-9ca5-703b6067cc4d\""}}""
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Notice `""Azure:Tenant""` appears both as a flat key and nested under the `""Azure""` object, creating duplication and potential conflicts.

## Root Cause

The `JsonExtensions.Prop()` method creates nested JSON structures while existing user secrets use flat colon-separated keys (the standard .NET configuration format). When provisioning adds new values using `Prop()`, it doesn't merge with existing flat keys, leading to both formats coexisting.

## Solution

Modified `DefaultUserSecretsManager.SaveUserSecretsAsync()` to normalize all JSON objects to flat colon-separated configuration format before saving. This ensures consistency with how Visual Studio and `dotnet user-secrets` CLI store configuration.

### Key Changes

1. **Added `FlattenJsonObject()` helper method** that recursively converts nested JSON to flat keys:
   - `""Azure"": { ""Tenant"": ""value"" }` → `""Azure:Tenant"": ""value""`
   - `""Azure"": { ""Deployments"": { ""MyStorage"": { ""Id"": ""value"" } } }` → `""Azure:Deployments:MyStorage:Id"": ""value""`

2. **Updated `SaveUserSecretsAsync()`** to flatten the JSON before writing to disk

### After Fix

The same scenario now produces clean, flat configuration:

```json
{
  ""Azure:SubscriptionId"": ""07268dd7-4c50-434b-b1ff-67b8164edb41"",
  ""Azure:Tenant"": ""microsoft.onmicrosoft.com"",
  ""Azure:Location"": ""eastus2"",
  ""Azure:Deployments:MyStorage:Id"": ""/subscriptions/07268dd7-4c50-434b-b1ff-67b8164edb41/resourceGroups/rg-aspire/providers/Microsoft.Resources/deployments/MyStorage"",
  ""Azure:Deployments:MyStorage:Parameters"": ""{\""principalId\"":{\""value\"":\""e2c0aecb-0cc9-412c-9ca5-703b6067cc4d\""}}""
}
```

## Benefits

- **Eliminates duplication**: No more conflicting flat and nested entries
- **Maintains compatibility**: Works with existing flat secrets and .NET configuration system
- **Follows conventions**: Matches format used by Visual Studio and `dotnet user-secrets` CLI
- **Minimal impact**: Only affects the save operation, preserving all existing functionality

## Testing

Added comprehensive unit tests covering:
- Handling of mixed flat and nested structures
- Preservation of existing flat values
- Deep nesting scenarios
- Null and primitive value handling
- Empty object handling

3135639537,9816,Enhance AppHostExitsWhenCliProcessPidDies test diagnostics and add quarantined test filtering documentation,"## Overview

This PR addresses two issues with the quarantined `AppHostExitsWhenCliProcessPidDies` test:

1. **Enhanced test diagnostics** to understand why the test is failing
2. **Complete documentation and validation** for quarantined test filtering

## Problem Statement

The `AppHostExitsWhenCliProcessPidDies` test in `tests/Aspire.Cli.Tests/Hosting/CliOrphanDetectorTests.cs` was quarantined due to flakiness, but the root cause was unknown. Additionally, some test runners (like Copilot agent) were not properly filtering quarantined tests, causing false negatives.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Test Diagnostics

**Before**: Simple test with minimal logging that would mysteriously fail or pass
```csharp
[Fact]
[QuarantinedTest(""https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/issues/7920"")]
public async Task AppHostExitsWhenCliProcessPidDies()
{
    // Simple test with no diagnostics
    await pendingRun.WaitAsync(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(10));
}
```

**After**: Comprehensive diagnostics with multi-run capability
```csharp
[Theory]
[InlineData(1)]
[InlineData(2)]
[InlineData(3)]
[QuarantinedTest(""https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/issues/7920"")]
public async Task AppHostExitsWhenCliProcessPidDies(int runNumber)
{
    testOutputHelper.WriteLine($""=== Starting AppHostExitsWhenCliProcessPidDies run #{runNumber} ==="");
    var stopwatch = Stopwatch.StartNew();
    
    // Detailed logging throughout test execution
    testOutputHelper.WriteLine($""[Run {runNumber}] Creating fake CLI process..."");
    // ... comprehensive timing and status information
}
```

**Key improvements**:
- ✅ **Multi-run testing**: Theory with InlineData runs the test 3 times to verify consistency
- ✅ **Timing diagnostics**: Stopwatch tracking throughout test execution
- ✅ **Process status logging**: Detailed information about CLI process creation, monitoring, and termination
- ✅ **Exception capture**: Full stack traces and error context
- ✅ **Root cause identification**: Test now shows the exact failure point (CliOrphanDetector not working)

### 2. Quarantined Test Filtering Documentation

Added comprehensive documentation and validation for quarantined test filtering:

**New files**:
- `docs/quarantined-tests.md` - Complete guide on working with quarantined tests
- `docs/test-analysis-cli-orphan-detector.md` - Detailed analysis of the failing test
- `validate-quarantine-filtering.sh` - Script to verify filtering works correctly

**Updated files**:
- `docs/contributing.md` - Added testing section with quarantine filter guidance

**Key features**:
- ✅ **Correct filter syntax**: `--filter-not-trait ""quarantined=true""` for excluding quarantined tests
- ✅ **Usage examples**: Both inclusion and exclusion scenarios documented
- ✅ **Validation script**: Demonstrates and verifies filtering works (67 total tests, 63 non-quarantined, 4 quarantined)
- ✅ **CI integration**: Confirmed existing workflows use correct filters

## Root Cause Analysis

The enhanced diagnostics revealed that the test is **not actually flaky** - it's **consistently broken** due to a bug in the `CliOrphanDetector` implementation:

1. ✅ **Fake CLI process creation**: Works correctly
2. ✅ **Application startup**: DistributedApplication starts successfully  
3. ✅ **Resources creation**: AfterResourcesCreatedEvent fires as expected
4. ✅ **CLI process kill**: Process.Kill() succeeds, HasExited=True
5. ❌ **Application shutdown**: App continues running instead of shutting down
6. ❌ **Timeout**: Test times out after 10 seconds waiting for app exit

**The issue**: The `CliOrphanDetector` hosted service is not detecting when the CLI process dies and therefore not calling `lifetime.StopApplication()` to shut down the host.

## Testing

```bash
# Verify quarantine filtering works
./validate-quarantine-filtering.sh

# Run tests excluding quarantined (what CI does)
dotnet test --filter-not-trait ""quarantined=true""

# Run only quarantined tests (for debugging)
dotnet test --filter-trait ""quarantined=true""

# Run enhanced test with full diagnostics
dotnet exec artifacts/bin/Aspire.Cli.Tests/Debug/net8.0/Aspire.Cli.Tests.dll --filter-method ""*AppHostExitsWhenCliProcessPidDies*"" --show-live-output on
```

## Impact

### ✅ Quarantined Test Filtering - **SOLVED**
- Test runners can now reliably exclude quarantined tests using documented filters
- Reduces false negatives in automated testing environments
- Provides clear guidance for developers working with quarantined tests

### ✅ Test Diagnostics - **ENHANCED**  
- The failing test now provides actionable diagnostic information
- Root cause identified for future fixing (CliOrphanDetector mechanism broken)
- Test can be used to verify any future fix to the CliOrphanDetector

## Next Steps

The enhanced test and analysis provide a clear path forward for fixing the underlying `CliOrphanDetector` issue:

1. Add logging to `CliOrphanDetector` class to debug process detection
2. Verify hosted service registration in test environments
3. Fix the process monitoring mechanism
4. Remove quarantine attribute once verified stable

## Files Changed

- `tests/Aspire.Cli.Tests/Hosting/CliOrphanDetectorTests.cs` - Enhanced test with diagnostics
- `docs/quarantined-tests.md` - New quarantine filtering documentation
- `docs/contributing.md` - Added testing section with quarantine guidance
- `docs/test-analysis-cli-orphan-detector.md` - Detailed failure analysis
- `validate-quarantine-filtering.sh` - Validation script for filtering

The changes are minimal and focused, following the principle of surgical modifications while providing maximum diagnostic value for future investigations.",Copilot,198982749,Copilot,closed,2025-06-11T06:25:47Z,2025-06-13T07:14:56Z,2025-06-13T07:14:56Z,696529789.0,https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/aspire,https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/pull/9816,agent,696529789.0,https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/aspire,MIT,dotnet/aspire,C#,659.0,4723.0

3090578689,9511,Allow mounting the docker socket using WithBindMount,"## Changes
This PR addresses the need to mount `/var/run/docker.sock` into containers, enabling Docker-in-Docker scenarios. Two main changes were made:

1. Modified the `WithBindMount` method to special-case Linux-style absolute paths (those starting with `/`):
   - Paths starting with `/` are now passed through directly without attempting to resolve them relative to the AppHost directory
   - This fixes issues when running on Windows with Docker socket paths

2. Added a new convenience extension method `WithDockerSocketBindMount()` that:
   - Makes it simple to mount the Docker socket with a single method call
   - Automatically binds `/var/run/docker.sock` to `/var/run/docker.sock` in the container

## Tests Added
- Added a basic unit test for `ContainerMountAnnotation` that verifies it accepts `/var/run/docker.sock` as a valid bind mount source
- Added a unit test for `WithBindMount` that verifies it correctly handles Docker socket paths
- Added a unit test for the new `WithDockerSocketBindMount` method to verify it creates the correct annotation
- Added a basic functional test in `DockerSocketBindMountTests.cs` to verify the Docker socket binding works correctly

Before this change, users could not easily mount the Docker socket into containers when specifying Linux paths on Windows hosts, as the code would incorrectly try to resolve `/var/run/docker.sock` as a relative path.

Fixes #7077.

    def predict(cls, x, y):
        return x + y

Model.predict(1, 2)  # Would fail with TypeError: 'classmethod' object is not callable

The changes:

1. Modified the `trace` decorator to detect if a function is a classmethod or staticmethod descriptor
2. When detected, extract the original function using `__func__`, apply tracing, and wrap it back as the appropriate descriptor type
3. Added tests for both decorator ordering patterns:
   - `@mlflow.trace` followed by `@classmethod`/`@staticmethod`
   - `@classmethod`/`@staticmethod` followed by `@mlflow.trace`
4. Updated the documentation to indicate that classmethods and staticmethods are now supported

This implementation handles both possible ordering of decorators, making the API more flexible for users.

</details>

## Problem

PR #16653 changed the position of the `tracking_uri` parameter in artifact repository constructors, but several calls throughout the codebase still passed `tracking_uri` as a positional argument instead of using keyword arguments.

This caused `tracking_uri` to be interpreted as `access_key_id` in `S3ArtifactRepository`, breaking artifact storage functionality when a tracking URI is provided.

## Example of the bug

```python
# Before fix: tracking_uri passed as positional argument
get_artifact_repository(uri, self.tracking_uri)

# S3ArtifactRepository constructor:
# def __init__(self, artifact_uri, access_key_id=None, ..., tracking_uri=None)
# Result: tracking_uri becomes access_key_id! 
```

## Solution

Updated all calls to pass `tracking_uri` as a keyword argument:

```python
# After fix: tracking_uri passed as keyword argument  
get_artifact_repository(uri, tracking_uri=self.tracking_uri)
```

## Changes Made

- **`runs_artifact_repo.py`**: Fixed 2 calls in `__init__` and `_get_logged_model_artifact_repo`
- **`artifact_repository_registry.py`**: Fixed registry call that creates all artifact repositories
- **`dbfs_artifact_repo.py`**: Fixed 4 factory function calls for consistency
- **`uc_volume_artifact_repo.py`**: Fixed 2 factory function calls for consistency
- **`test_runs_artifact_repo.py`**: Added test to verify the fix

## Impact

- ✅ S3ArtifactRepository no longer receives `tracking_uri` as `access_key_id`
- ✅ All artifact repositories are created with correct parameters
- ✅ Changes are minimal and maintain backward compatibility
- ✅ Comprehensive tests verify the fix works correctly

Fixes #16873.

This PR implements automatic ID generation for Rule classes in the clint linter, eliminating the need to manually implement `_id()` methods in each Rule subclass.

## Problem

Previously, each Rule subclass had to manually implement the `_id()` method to return a unique identifier (e.g., ""MLF0001"", ""MLF0002"", etc.). This was error-prone and required manual tracking of which IDs had been used across 25+ rule classes.

## Solution

Implemented automatic ID generation using `__init_subclass__` with `itertools.count`:

- **Auto-generation mechanism**: Uses `__init_subclass__` to assign unique IDs when classes are defined
- **Thread-safe incrementing**: Uses `itertools.count` for reliable auto-incrementing
- **Preserves existing IDs**: All 25 existing rule IDs (MLF0001-MLF0025) remain exactly the same
- **Clean implementation**: Removes 79 lines of boilerplate code while adding only 12 lines

## Key Changes

1. **Updated Rule base class** in `dev/clint/src/clint/rules.py`:
   ```python
   class Rule(ABC):
       _id_counter = itertools.count(start=1)
       _generated_id: str

       def __init_subclass__(cls, **kwargs):
           super().__init_subclass__(**kwargs)
           # Only generate ID for concrete classes
           if not inspect.isabstract(cls):
               cls._generated_id = f""MLF{next(cls._id_counter):04d}""

       def _id(self) -> str:
           """"""Return the auto-generated ID for this rule.""""""
           return self._generated_id
   ```

2. **Removed manual `_id()` implementations** from all 25 rule subclasses while preserving their exact functionality.

## Benefits

- ✅ **Eliminates manual ID tracking** - No more need to remember which IDs are taken
- ✅ **Reduces boilerplate code** - 67 lines net reduction (79 deleted, 12 added)  
- ✅ **Prevents ID collisions** - Automatic incrementing ensures uniqueness
- ✅ **Makes adding new rules easier** - New rules automatically get the next available ID
- ✅ **Backward compatible** - All existing IDs preserved exactly
- ✅ **Thread-safe** - Uses `itertools.count` for reliable auto-incrementing

## Verification

All 25 rule IDs are verified to match their original values:
- NoRst: MLF0001 ✓
- LazyBuiltinImport: MLF0002 ✓  
- MlflowClassName: MLF0003 ✓
- ... (all 25 rules verified)

The clint linter continues to work correctly with the new auto-generation mechanism.

Fixes #16306.

3241546085,10521,Update AddSecret extension methods to use consistent parameter names,"This PR updates the `AddSecret` extension methods in `AzureKeyVaultResourceExtensions` to use consistent parameter naming conventions.

## Changes Made

Updated the parameter names in three `AddSecret` method overloads to follow a consistent pattern:

**Before:**
```csharp
AddSecret(builder, secretName, IResourceBuilder<ParameterResource> parameterResource)
AddSecret(builder, secretName, ParameterResource parameterResource)  
AddSecret(builder, secretName, ReferenceExpression value)
```

**After:**
```csharp
AddSecret(builder, name, IResourceBuilder<ParameterResource> parameterResource)
AddSecret(builder, name, ParameterResource parameterResource)
AddSecret(builder, name, ReferenceExpression value)
```

**Additional Change:**

Discovered during testing that KeyVault secret resources were being emitted into the manifest that AZD uses as an error type. Looks like we didn't test that path so I'm excludiing them from the manifest in this PR to fix that issue. Also added a test to cover it.

## Consistency Achieved

Now all `AddSecret` methods follow the same parameter naming pattern:
- **2-parameter methods:** `AddSecret(builder, name, parameter)` - where `name` is both the resource name and secret name
- **3-parameter methods:** `AddSecret(builder, name, secretName, parameter)` - where `name` is the resource name and `secretName` is the Key Vault secret name

## Backward Compatibility

✅ **No breaking changes** - All existing code continues to work since:
- Method calls use positional arguments
- Only parameter names changed, not parameter types or order
- XML documentation updated to reflect new parameter names

## Files Changed

- `src/Aspire.Hosting.Azure.KeyVault/AzureKeyVaultResourceExtensions.cs`

The existing tests continue to pass without modification, confirming backward compatibility.

3241591765,10523,Add EmulatorResourceAnnotation to Azure emulator resources for consistent tooling support,"## Problem

Several Azure emulator resources in Aspire were missing the `EmulatorResourceAnnotation` when running in emulator mode, which is needed for consistent resource identification and tooling support. This annotation is used by the `IsEmulator()` extension method and provisioning logic to properly handle emulator resources.

The following Azure services were affected:
- Azure Storage (`RunAsEmulator`)
- Azure Event Hubs (`RunAsEmulator`) 
- Azure Service Bus (`RunAsEmulator`)
- Azure SignalR (`RunAsEmulator`)
- Azure CosmosDB (`RunAsEmulator` and `RunAsPreviewEmulator`)

## Solution

Added `EmulatorResourceAnnotation` to all Azure emulator resources following the established pattern from Azure AI Foundry. Each `RunAsEmulator` method now includes:

```csharp
// Mark this resource as an emulator for consistent resource identification and tooling support
builder.WithAnnotation(new EmulatorResourceAnnotation());
```

This ensures that:
- `resource.IsEmulator()` returns `true` for all emulator resources
- Provisioning logic can properly identify and handle emulator resources
- Tooling has consistent way to detect emulator mode across all Azure services

## Changes Made

1. **Added annotation to 5 Azure services**: Updated each `RunAsEmulator` method to apply the annotation
2. **Added comprehensive tests**: Created `RunAsEmulatorAppliesEmulatorResourceAnnotation()` tests for each service
3. **Minimal surgical changes**: Only added the missing annotation, no other modifications

## Testing

- ✅ 5 new tests specifically verify `EmulatorResourceAnnotation` is applied
- ✅ All existing emulator functionality tests continue to pass
- ✅ Build succeeds with no breaking changes
- ✅ Verified with both regular and preview emulator modes

The fix is minimal, surgical, and follows the established pattern while ensuring consistency across all Azure emulator implementations.

*This pull request was created as a result of the following prompt from Copilot chat.*
> ## Problem: Emulator Resources Missing EmulatorResourceAnnotation
> 
> Several Aspire resource types (Azure Storage, Azure Event Hubs, Azure Service Bus, Azure SignalR) support running with a local emulator via RunAsEmulator (or similar) methods. However, these resources do not consistently apply EmulatorResourceAnnotation when running in emulator mode, which is needed for consistent resource identification and tooling support.
> 
> ## Required Changes:
> - For each resource with a RunAsEmulator (or equivalent) method, ensure that EmulatorResourceAnnotation is added to the resource when emulator mode is enabled. 
> - Apply this fix in:
>   - src/Aspire.Hosting.Azure.Storage/AzureStorageExtensions.cs
>   - src/Aspire.Hosting.Azure.EventHubs/AzureEventHubsExtensions.cs
>   - src/Aspire.Hosting.Azure.ServiceBus/AzureServiceBusExtensions.cs
>   - src/Aspire.Hosting.Azure.SignalR/AzureSignalRExtensions.cs
> - For each, add `.WithAnnotation(new EmulatorResourceAnnotation())` to the emulator setup pipeline in the appropriate location.
> - Verify if CosmosDB also requires this change and update if necessary.
> - Add a brief comment for maintainers indicating why the annotation is being added.
> - Ensure existing tests (if any) for emulator mode pass and update/add a minimal test if required to cover the annotation logic.
> 
> ## Acceptance Criteria:
> - All emulator-enabled resources consistently apply EmulatorResourceAnnotation when running as an emulator.
> - Code is clear, self-explanatory, and includes a brief rationale comment for future maintainers.

This PR adds the PLW1508 lint rule to the ruff configuration in `pyproject.toml`. 

**What PLW1508 does:**
PLW1508 (`invalid-envvar-default`) checks for `os.getenv` calls with invalid default values. It ensures that default values passed to `os.getenv` are either strings or `None`, which maintains type consistency since `os.getenv` always returns a string when an environment variable is set.

**Example of what it catches:**
```python
import os

# Bad - inconsistent types
value = os.getenv(""FOO"", 1)  # Returns int if FOO is unset, str if set

# Good - consistent types  
value = os.getenv(""FOO"", ""1"")  # Always returns str
value = os.getenv(""FOO"", None)  # Returns str or None
```

**Changes made:**
- Added `""PLW1508""` to the `select` list in `[tool.ruff.lint]` section of `pyproject.toml`
- Positioned alphabetically after existing PLW rules

**Verification:**
- Confirmed no existing violations in the codebase
- Tested that the rule correctly identifies violations
- Verified all existing linting continues to pass

Fixes #16888.

3267839579,10688,Rename EventingExtensions class to DistributedApplicationEventingExtensions,"This PR renames the `EventingExtensions` class to `DistributedApplicationEventingExtensions` to provide a more descriptive and specific name that clearly indicates its purpose and scope within the Aspire hosting framework.

## Changes Made

- **Class Rename**: Changed class definition from `EventingExtensions` to `DistributedApplicationEventingExtensions` in the source file
- **File Rename**: Renamed the file from `EventingExtensions.cs` to `DistributedApplicationEventingExtensions.cs` to match the new class name

## Impact

This is a **non-breaking change** for consumers of the library because:

- All extension methods (`OnBeforeResourceStarted`, `OnConnectionStringAvailable`, `OnInitializeResource`, `OnResourceEndpointsAllocated`, `OnResourceReady`) remain functionally identical
- Extension methods are accessed by their method names, not the class name that contains them
- Existing code using these extension methods will continue to work without any modifications
- The class is only used internally by the C# compiler for method resolution

## Verification

- ✅ All builds pass successfully after the rename
- ✅ Existing tests that use the extension methods continue to work without modification
- ✅ No references to the old class name remain in the codebase
- ✅ Build artifacts and XML documentation now correctly reference the new class name

The new name `DistributedApplicationEventingExtensions` better reflects that these are extension methods specifically for distributed application resource eventing, making the codebase more maintainable and self-documenting.

3222755095,5990,Add analyzer for incorrect TestContext property usage in fixture methods,"This PR implements a new analyzer (`MSTEST0047`) that detects incorrect usage of TestContext properties in assembly initialize, class initialize, class cleanup, or assembly cleanup methods.

## Problem

Some TestContext properties are only available during test execution and should not be accessed in fixture methods. Currently, developers might attempt to access these properties in fixture methods without any warnings, leading to potential runtime issues.

## Solution

The new `TestContextPropertyUsageAnalyzer` detects when restricted TestContext properties are accessed in inappropriate contexts:

### Properties that cannot be accessed in assembly initialize, class initialize, class cleanup, or assembly cleanup:
- `TestData`
- `TestDisplayName` 
- `DataRow` (when available on .NET Framework)
- `DataConnection` (when available on .NET Framework)
- `TestName`
- `ManagedMethod`

### Properties that cannot be accessed in assembly initialize or assembly cleanup only:
- `FullyQualifiedTestClassName`
- `ManagedType`

## Example

```csharp
[TestClass]
public class MyTestClass
{
    [AssemblyInitialize]
    public static void AssemblyInit(TestContext testContext)
    {
        // These will now generate MSTEST0047 warnings
        _ = testContext.TestData;        // ❌ Warning
        _ = testContext.TestName;        // ❌ Warning
        _ = testContext.ManagedMethod;   // ❌ Warning
        
        // These are still allowed
        _ = testContext.Properties;      // ✅ OK
        testContext.WriteLine(""test"");   // ✅ OK
    }
    
    [ClassInitialize]
    public static void ClassInit(TestContext testContext)
    {
        // These generate warnings
        _ = testContext.TestData;        // ❌ Warning
        _ = testContext.TestName;        // ❌ Warning
        
        // These are allowed in class initialize
        _ = testContext.FullyQualifiedTestClassName; // ✅ OK
        _ = testContext.ManagedType;     // ✅ OK
    }
    
    [TestMethod]
    public void TestMethod()
    {
        // All properties are allowed in test methods
        _ = TestContext.TestData;        // ✅ OK
        _ = TestContext.TestName;        // ✅ OK
    }
}
```

## Implementation Details

- **Diagnostic ID**: MSTEST0047
- **Severity**: Warning
- **Category**: Usage
- Uses `OperationKind.PropertyReference` to detect property access
- Checks method attributes to determine context
- Includes comprehensive test coverage
- Supports all localized languages

## Files Changed

- Added `TestContextPropertyUsageAnalyzer.cs` - Main analyzer implementation
- Updated `DiagnosticIds.cs` - Added MSTEST0047 diagnostic ID
- Updated `Resources.resx` and all `.xlf` files - Added localized messages
- Updated `PublicAPI.Unshipped.txt` - Added public API entries
- Updated `AnalyzerReleases.Unshipped.md` - Added release notes
- Added comprehensive test suite

Fixes #5989.

## Summary

Updated the prettier configuration in `docs/package.json` to include CSS files alongside the existing TypeScript/TSX and Markdown/MDX file formatting. This ensures consistent code style across all supported file types in the documentation.

## Changes Made

Updated both prettier scripts in `docs/package.json`:

**Before:**
```json
""prettier:fix"": ""prettier \""{**/*.(ts|tsx),**/*.(md|mdx)}\"" --write"",
""prettier:check"": ""prettier \""{**/*.(ts|tsx),**/*.(md|mdx)}\"" --check"",
```

**After:**
```json
""prettier:fix"": ""prettier \""{**/*.(ts|tsx),**/*.(md|mdx),**/*.css}\"" --write"",
""prettier:check"": ""prettier \""{**/*.(ts|tsx),**/*.(md|mdx),**/*.css}\"" --check"",
```

## Impact

- ✅ 12 CSS files in the docs directory are now properly formatted
- ✅ Consistent single quote usage and formatting across all CSS files
- ✅ Existing TypeScript/TSX and Markdown/MDX formatting continues to work correctly
- ✅ Better code quality and readability for CSS files
- ✅ Aligns with existing formatting practices for other file types

## Testing

- Verified that `yarn prettier:check` passes for all file types (TypeScript/TSX, Markdown/MDX, and CSS)
- Confirmed that `yarn prettier:fix` successfully formats CSS files according to the prettier configuration
- Tested that existing functionality for other file types remains intact

Fixes #16525.

3179388883,10064,Fix AzurePublishingContext to ignore resources with ManifestPublishingCallbackAnnotation.Ignore,"The `AzurePublishingContext` was not respecting the `ManifestPublishingCallbackAnnotation.Ignore` annotation when gathering `AzureBicepResource` instances for publishing. This caused resources that were explicitly marked to be ignored during manifest publishing to still be included in the Azure bicep generation process.

## Changes Made

Modified `AzurePublishingContext.WriteAzureArtifactsOutputAsync` to filter out resources with the ignore annotation, following the same pattern used in `DistributedApplicationModelExtensions.GetComputeResources()`:

**Before:**
```csharp
var bicepResourcesToPublish = model.Resources.OfType<AzureBicepResource>().ToList();
```

**After:**
```csharp
var bicepResourcesToPublish = model.Resources.OfType<AzureBicepResource>()
    .Where(r => !r.TryGetLastAnnotation<ManifestPublishingCallbackAnnotation>(out var lastAnnotation) || lastAnnotation != ManifestPublishingCallbackAnnotation.Ignore)
    .ToList();
```

This ensures consistency across the codebase and properly excludes Azure bicep resources that have been explicitly marked to be ignored during the publishing process.

## Testing

- ✅ Project builds successfully
- ✅ Logic verified against existing pattern in `DistributedApplicationModelExtensions`
- ✅ Minimal change approach maintained

Fixes #10063.

3272051898,16927,Sort requirements alphabetically in generate_requirements.py output,"The `dev/generate_requirements.py` script was generating requirements files without sorting the requirements, leading to non-deterministic diffs and unnecessary changes in version control when packages were added or modified in the YAML files.

## Changes Made

This PR adds alphabetical sorting to the requirements generation process by adding a single line `requirement_strs.sort()` in the `generate_requirements_txt_content()` function before joining the requirement strings.

**Before:**
```
# requirements/core-requirements.txt (unsorted)
alembic<2,!=1.10.0
docker<8,>=4.0.0
Flask<4
numpy<3
scipy<2
pandas<3
sqlalchemy<3,>=1.4.0
gunicorn<24; platform_system != 'Windows'
waitress<4; platform_system == 'Windows'
scikit-learn<2
pyarrow<21,>=4.0.0
matplotlib<4
graphene<4
```

**After:**
```
# requirements/core-requirements.txt (alphabetically sorted)
Flask<4
alembic<2,!=1.10.0
docker<8,>=4.0.0
graphene<4
gunicorn<24; platform_system != 'Windows'
matplotlib<4
numpy<3
pandas<3
pyarrow<21,>=4.0.0
scikit-learn<2
scipy<2
sqlalchemy<3,>=1.4.0
waitress<4; platform_system == 'Windows'
```

## Impact

- **Cleaner diffs**: Requirements are now consistently ordered, eliminating spurious changes when packages are reordered
- **Better maintainability**: Developers can easily find specific packages in the requirements files
- **Deterministic output**: Running the script multiple times produces identical results
- **No functional changes**: The actual dependency specifications remain unchanged

All requirements files (`core-requirements.txt`, `skinny-requirements.txt`, `gateway-requirements.txt`, `tracing-requirements.txt`) have been regenerated with the new sorted format.

Fixes #16925.

3246121444,10562,Ensure idempotency for AddAsExistingResource across all Azure resource implementations,"The `AddAsExistingResource` method was not idempotent across Azure resource provisioning implementations. When called multiple times with the same resource, it would add duplicate entries to the infrastructure, causing issues in automated deployment scenarios.

## Problem

```csharp
var storageResource = new AzureStorageResource(""test-storage"", _ => { });
var infrastructure = new AzureResourceInfrastructure(storageResource, ""test-storage"");

// Multiple calls would create duplicate resources
var first = storageResource.AddAsExistingResource(infrastructure);
var second = storageResource.AddAsExistingResource(infrastructure);

// Before: first != second (different instances, duplicates created)
// After: first == second (same instance, idempotent behavior)
```

## Solution

Updated all 19 Azure resource implementations to follow the same idempotency pattern already used in `AsKeyVaultSecret`:

1. Get the bicep identifier and existing resources
2. Check if a resource with the same `BicepIdentifier` already exists
3. If found, return the existing resource
4. If not found, create and add the new resource

## Resources Fixed

- ✅ AzureStorageResource
- ✅ AzureKeyVaultResource
- ✅ AzureRedisCacheResource
- ✅ AzureEventHubsResource
- ✅ AzureSignalRResource
- ✅ AzureSqlServerResource
- ✅ AzureSearchResource
- ✅ AzureContainerRegistryResource
- ✅ AzureOpenAIResource
- ✅ AzureServiceBusResource
- ✅ AzureAppConfigurationResource
- ✅ AzureCosmosDBResource
- ✅ AzurePostgresFlexibleServerResource
- ✅ AzureWebPubSubResource
- ✅ AzureUserAssignedIdentityResource
- ✅ AzureAppServiceEnvironmentResource
- ✅ AzureAIFoundryResource
- ✅ AzureLogAnalyticsWorkspaceResource
- ✅ AzureContainerAppEnvironmentResource

## Benefits

- **Idempotency**: Repeated calls no longer create duplicate resources
- **Reliability**: More predictable behavior in automated deployments
- **Consistency**: All Azure resources now behave identically
- **Performance**: Avoids unnecessary resource creation overhead

## Testing

Added test cases to verify idempotency behavior and ensured all builds pass successfully.

Fixes #10560.

3189091502,10145,Rename and refactor steps/tasks-related publishing APIs,"This PR refactors the publishing activity progress reporting APIs to provide a more intuitive and fluent interface pattern as requested in #10144.

## Changes Made

### New Interface Design
- **`IPublishingActivityProgressReporter`** - Now returns interface types instead of concrete classes
- **`IPublishingStep`** - New interface for step operations with `CreateTaskAsync()` and `CompleteAsync()` methods
- **`IPublishingTask`** - New interface for task operations with `UpdateAsync()` and `CompleteAsync()` methods

### Updated API Call Pattern
The new API enables the fluent call pattern specified in the issue:

```csharp
var reporter = builder.Services.GetService<IPublishingActivityProgressReporter>();

using var step = await reporter.CreateStepAsync(""Build images"", ct);
using var task = await step.CreateTaskAsync(""docker build -t web:latest ."", ct);

await task.UpdateAsync(""Pushing layers…"", ct);
await task.CompleteAsync(CompletionState.Completed, ""Image pushed"", ct);

await step.CompleteAsync(""Build & push complete"", CompletionState.Completed, ct);
await reporter.CompletePublishAsync(CompletionState.Completed, ct);
```

### Key Method Signature Changes
- `CreateStepAsync()` returns `IPublishingStep` instead of `PublishingStep`
- `CreateTaskAsync()` is now called directly on the step object
- `CompleteAsync()` methods have cleaner parameter ordering with completion state first
- All methods include proper default parameter values

### Backward Compatibility
- Maintained internal compatibility via `IInternalPublishingActivityProgressReporter`
- Updated existing callers (`ResourceContainerImageBuilder`, `Publisher`) to use new patterns
- `NullPublishingActivityProgressReporter` supports both old and new interfaces

### Implementation Details
- `PublishingStep` and `PublishingTask` now implement the new interfaces
- Explicit interface implementation keeps internal methods hidden from public API
- Comprehensive test coverage validates the new call patterns work correctly

This refactoring provides the cleaner, more discoverable API requested while maintaining full backward compatibility for existing internal usage.

Fixes #10144

3107459473,9619,Externalize unknown parameters in ContainerApps and AppServiceWebSite,"## Summary

Both Azure Container Apps and App Service previously threw exceptions when encountering unknown `IManifestExpressionProvider` types in their `ProcessValue` methods. This change updates the behavior to defer computation to the caller by calling `AllocateParameter`, following the same pattern as Docker compose processing.

## Changes Made

Added checks for `IManifestExpressionProvider` before the `throw` statements in both:
- `ContainerAppContext.ProcessValue` method
- `AzureAppServiceWebsiteContext.ProcessValue` method

Instead of throwing `NotSupportedException`, the code now:
1. Checks if the value implements `IManifestExpressionProvider`
2. Calls `AllocateParameter(manifestExpressionProvider, secretType)` to defer computation
3. Returns the allocated parameter with the appropriate secret type

## Example

Before this change, passing an unknown `IManifestExpressionProvider` would result in:
```
NotSupportedException: Unsupported value type CustomExpressionProvider
```

After this change, the unknown provider is properly handled by allocating a parameter for deferred computation.

## Pattern Consistency

This follows the same pattern established in `DockerComposeServiceResourceExtensions.cs`:
```csharp
// Docker compose handling
if (value is IManifestExpressionProvider r)
{
    return r.AsEnvironmentPlaceholder(resource);
}
```

But uses the Azure-appropriate `AllocateParameter` method instead of `AsEnvironmentPlaceholder`.

Fixes #9617.

3107462147,9620,Add support for containers with Dockerfile to AzureAppServiceEnvironmentResource,"This PR extends Azure App Service infrastructure to support containers with Dockerfile, enabling deployment of non-.NET projects to Azure App Service.

## Problem

Previously, `AzureAppServiceInfrastructure` only supported `ProjectResource` types, limiting deployments to .NET projects only. This prevented containerized applications with Dockerfiles from being deployed to Azure App Service.

## Solution

Modified the resource filtering logic in `AzureAppServiceInfrastructure.cs` to support both:
- **ProjectResource** (existing .NET projects) 
- **Container resources** with `DockerfileBuildAnnotation` (detected via `IsContainer()`)

The change follows the exact same pattern used by Azure Container Apps infrastructure.

### Before
```csharp
// We only support project resources for now.
if (resource is not ProjectResource)
{
    continue;
}
```

### After  
```csharp
// Support project resources and containers with Dockerfile
if (resource is not ProjectResource && !resource.IsContainer())
{
    continue;
}
```

## Testing

Added `AddDockerfileWithAppServiceInfrastructureAddsDeploymentTargetWithAppServiceToContainerResources()` test that:
- Creates a temporary Dockerfile
- Uses `builder.AddDockerfile()` to add a container resource
- Verifies the container gets proper `DeploymentTargetAnnotation` for Azure App Service

This test follows the same pattern as existing Azure Container Apps tests.

## Impact

- ✅ **Backward compatible** - existing .NET project deployments continue to work unchanged
- ✅ **Minimal changes** - only 2 lines modified in core infrastructure + test coverage
- ✅ **Enables new scenarios** - non-.NET projects (Node.js, Python, etc.) can now be deployed to Azure App Service using Dockerfiles

Fixes #9616.

- Added `[QuarantinedTest(""https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/issues/9916"")]` attribute to the `TracingEnablesTheRightActivitySource_Keyed` test method

## Impact

The flaky test is now excluded from regular CI test runs to prevent false negatives, but will continue to run in the outerloop workflow for monitoring. This follows the established pattern for handling flaky tests in the codebase.

## Verification

- ✅ Project builds successfully
- ✅ Regular test runs now exclude the quarantined test (112 tests vs previous 113)
- ✅ Quarantined test can still be run individually when filtering for `quarantined=true` trait

Fixes #9917.

3200632529,10253,Rename IPublishingActivityProgressReporter to IPublishingActivityReporter,"## Summary

This PR renames the `IPublishingActivityProgressReporter` interface and its implementing classes to use the shorter, more concise name `IPublishingActivityReporter`. The change affects:

- `IPublishingActivityProgressReporter` → `IPublishingActivityReporter`
- `PublishingActivityProgressReporter` → `PublishingActivityReporter`
- `NullPublishingActivityProgressReporter` → `NullPublishingActivityReporter`

## Changes Made

- **Interface Renaming**: Updated the main interface from `IPublishingActivityProgressReporter` to `IPublishingActivityReporter`
- **Implementation Classes**: Renamed both the concrete implementation and null object pattern implementation
- **File Renames**: Updated corresponding file names to match the new class names
- **References**: Updated all references throughout the codebase including:
  - Service registrations in `DistributedApplicationBuilder`
  - Usage in publishing contexts (`PublishingContext`, `DeployingContext`, etc.)
  - Test files and test class names
  - API definitions in generated files
  - Compatibility suppression entries

## Testing

- ✅ All 28 `PublishingActivityReporterTests` pass
- ✅ All 12 `PublishingTests` pass  
- ✅ 35/36 tests in Publishing namespace pass (1 unrelated infrastructure failure)
- ✅ Build succeeds without warnings
- ✅ JSON serialization of `PublishingActivity` works correctly with existing discriminator pattern

## Design Notes

The `PublishingActivity` class continues to use its existing string-based discriminator pattern (`Type` field) to distinguish between Step, Task, PublishComplete, and Prompt activities. This discriminated union approach is appropriate for the sealed class design and works correctly with JSON serialization.

## Breaking Changes

⚠️ **This is a breaking change** for any external code that references these types. However, since these APIs are marked with `[Experimental(""ASPIREPUBLISHERS001"")]`, breaking changes are expected and acceptable.

3232119740,6033,Use magic bytes for Mach-O check in DotnetMuxerLocator,"This PR implements proper magic bytes validation for Mach-O binaries in the `DotnetMuxerLocator` class as requested in issue #6032.

## Problem

The `GetMuxerArchitectureByMachoOnMac` method was reading magic bytes from binary files but never validating them against known Mach-O magic numbers. This meant the method could attempt to process non-Mach-O binaries as if they were valid Mach-O files, potentially leading to incorrect architecture detection.

## Solution

Added validation of magic bytes to ensure we're actually looking at a valid Mach-O binary before proceeding with CPU type detection.

### Changes Made

1. **Added Mach-O magic number constants** based on the [Wikipedia Mach-O specification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mach-O):
   - `MachOMagic32BigEndian = 0xfeedface` (32-bit big-endian)
   - `MachOMagic64BigEndian = 0xfeedfacf` (64-bit big-endian) 
   - `MachOMagic32LittleEndian = 0xcefaedfe` (32-bit little-endian)
   - `MachOMagic64LittleEndian = 0xcffaedfe` (64-bit little-endian)
   - `MachOMagicFatBigEndian = 0xcafebabe` (multi-architecture big-endian)

2. **Added validation logic** that checks the magic bytes against all valid Mach-O magic numbers before attempting architecture detection

3. **Enhanced logging** to report invalid magic bytes for debugging purposes

### Implementation Details

- **Endianness handling**: Correctly handles both big-endian and little-endian Mach-O binaries by validating against all magic number variants
- **Minimal changes**: Only 13 lines added, no existing functionality removed or modified  
- **Backward compatibility**: All existing behavior is preserved; this only adds missing validation
- **Error handling**: Invalid magic bytes are logged and the method returns null, allowing fallback to other detection methods

The implementation aligns with the existing pattern in the codebase where CPU types also have both ""Magic"" and ""Cigam"" (byte-swapped) variants to handle different endianness.

Fixes #6032.

3197755568,16541,Update example install code to use `pip install mlflow>=3` instead of git branch,"## Summary

Updated the example installation code in the MLflow UI from using a git branch to the standard PyPI installation method now that MLflow 3.0 has been officially released.

## Changes Made

The changes are minimal and focused on updating the installation instructions in `ExperimentLoggedModelListPageTableEmpty.tsx`:

1. **Installation command**: Changed from `pip install git+https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow@mlflow-3` to `pip install mlflow>=3`
2. **Description text**: Updated from ""Install mlflow from mlflow-3 branch:"" to ""Install mlflow version 3 or later:""
3. **Description parameter**: Updated the internationalization description to match the new installation method

## Visual Changes

![MLflow Installation Code Update](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/790d8a14-2873-4bcb-b2ae-7d796ee586b5)

The screenshot above shows the before/after comparison and demonstrates how the modal with example code will appear in the MLflow UI with the updated installation instructions.

## Impact

- **More user-friendly**: Standard PyPI installation is easier and more familiar to users
- **Best practices**: Follows standard Python package installation patterns
- **Official release**: MLflow 3.0 is now officially available on PyPI, making the git branch installation unnecessary
- **Minimal change**: Only 3 lines changed, keeping the impact focused and reducing risk

## Context

MLflow 3.0 has been officially released (as confirmed in the changelog with versions 3.0.1 and 3.1.x), making it appropriate to recommend the standard PyPI installation method instead of installing from the development branch.

Fixes #16540.

3226091042,10363,Mark ParameterResource.Value as obsolete in favor of GetValueAsync and direct usage,"Following the changes implemented in PRs #10354, #10359, and #10361, this PR marks `ParameterResource.Value` as obsolete to guide users toward the recommended patterns for parameter access.

## Changes Made

### 1. Obsoleted `ParameterResource.Value`
- Added `[Obsolete]` attribute with clear guidance message
- Updated XML documentation to recommend alternatives:
  - Use `GetValueAsync(CancellationToken)` for async value access
  - Pass the `ParameterResource` directly to methods that accept it (e.g., environment variables)

### 2. Updated Internal Usage
Updated internal infrastructure code to avoid obsolete warnings while preserving existing behavior:
- **Kubernetes Extensions**: For Helm value generation with default values
- **Docker Compose Extensions**: For environment variable defaults  
- **External Service Extensions**: For health check URL configuration

These internal uses employ `#pragma warning disable/restore` around legitimate synchronous access patterns required for infrastructure generation.

## Migration Examples

**Before (now obsolete):**
```csharp
var param = builder.AddParameter(""my-param"");
var value = param.Resource.Value; // ⚠️ Now shows obsolete warning
```

**Recommended patterns:**
```csharp
// For async access
var value = await param.Resource.GetValueAsync(cancellationToken);

// For environment variables (preferred)
builder.AddProject<Projects.MyApi>(""api"")
    .WithEnvironment(""MY_PARAM"", param.Resource); // Pass ParameterResource directly
```

## Impact
- **No breaking changes** - existing code continues to work
- **Compiler warnings** guide users toward recommended patterns
- **Clear migration path** through obsolete message
- **Internal infrastructure** unaffected

Fixes #10362.

3142541504,9872,Quarantine flaky test PublishCommandSucceedsEndToEnd,"This PR quarantines the flaky test `Aspire.Cli.Tests.Commands.PublishCommandTests.PublishCommandSucceedsEndToEnd` by adding the `[QuarantinedTest]` attribute.

## Changes Made

- Added `using Aspire.TestUtilities;` import to `PublishCommandTests.cs`
- Added `[QuarantinedTest(""https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/issues/9870"")]` attribute to the `PublishCommandSucceedsEndToEnd` test method

## Verification

The test is now properly quarantined:
- Regular test runs exclude quarantined tests (70 tests run instead of 72)
- Quarantined tests can still be executed specifically when needed
- The test continues to pass when run individually

The quarantined test will be excluded from regular CI runs but will continue to run in the outerloop workflow, allowing monitoring of its status while preventing it from blocking PR merges.

Fixes #9871.

This PR adds a new CircleCI step to display the size of the `docs/build/latest` directory after documentation is built. This will help monitor documentation build size and identify potential issues with documentation generation.

## Changes Made

- Added ""Show docs build size"" step in the `build_doc` job positioned between documentation build and sitemap comparison
- The step uses standard Unix tools (`du`, `find`, `sort`) to provide:
  - Total size of the `docs/build/latest` directory in human-readable format
  - Breakdown of the largest directories (top 10) for debugging
  - List of largest files over 1MB to help identify potential issues
- Includes error handling if the `docs/build/latest` directory doesn't exist

## Benefits

- **Better visibility** into documentation build output size
- **Easier debugging** of documentation build issues  
- **Monitoring** for unexpected size increases over time
- **Human-readable format** for easy interpretation by developers

## Example Output

```
=== Documentation build size ===
Total size of docs/build/latest directory:
42M     ./build/latest

Breakdown of largest directories:
42M     ./build/latest
15M     ./build/latest/api
8.2M    ./build/latest/static
3.1M    ./build/latest/docs

Largest files (>1MB):
5.2M    ./build/latest/static/js/main.bundle.js
2.8M    ./build/latest/static/css/styles.css
1.4M    ./build/latest/api/index.html
```

3142876413,5765,Add Assert.IsInRange API with three overloads,"This PR implements the `Assert.IsInRange` API as requested in the issue, providing a convenient way to test whether a value falls within an expected range.

## Changes Made

### API Implementation
Added three overloads to `Assert.Contains.cs`:

```csharp
public static void IsInRange<T>(T minValue, T maxValue, T value) 
    where T : struct, IComparable<T>

public static void IsInRange<T>(T minValue, T maxValue, T value, string? message) 
    where T : struct, IComparable<T>

public static void IsInRange<T>(T minValue, T maxValue, T value, 
    [StringSyntax(StringSyntaxAttribute.CompositeFormat)] string? message, 
    params object?[]? parameters) where T : struct, IComparable<T>
```

### Key Features
- **Inclusive Range Checking**: Tests if `minValue <= value <= maxValue` using `IComparable<T>.CompareTo()`
- **Type Safety**: Constraint `where T : struct, IComparable<T>` ensures only value types with comparison support
- **Consistent API**: Follows existing Assert method patterns with three overloads for different message scenarios
- **Proper Error Messages**: Displays clear failure messages with actual value and expected range

### Usage Examples
```csharp
// Basic usage
Assert.IsInRange(1, 10, 5);  // Passes

// With custom message
Assert.IsInRange(1, 10, 15, ""Value must be between 1 and 10"");  // Fails with custom message

// With formatted message
Assert.IsInRange(1.0, 5.0, 6.0, ""Expected value between {0} and {1}"", 1.0, 5.0);  // Fails with formatted message

// Works with various comparable types
Assert.IsInRange('A', 'Z', 'M');  // Character range
Assert.IsInRange(DateTime.Today, DateTime.Today.AddDays(7), DateTime.Today.AddDays(3));  // Date range
```

### Error Message Format
When assertions fail, the error message follows the format:
```
Value 'actualValue' is not within the expected range [minValue, maxValue]. userMessage
```

### Testing
Added comprehensive test suite (`AssertTests.IsInRange.cs`) covering:
- Values within range (should pass)
- Values at min/max boundaries (should pass)
- Values below/above range (should fail with proper messages)
- Custom messages and parameter formatting
- Multiple data types (int, double, DateTime, char)
- Edge cases and null/empty message handling

### Files Modified
- `src/TestFramework/TestFramework/Assertions/Assert.Contains.cs` - Added IsInRange methods
- `src/TestFramework/TestFramework/Resources/FrameworkMessages.resx` - Added IsInRangeFail message
- `test/UnitTests/TestFramework.UnitTests/Assertions/AssertTests.IsInRange.cs` - Added comprehensive tests

The implementation follows established patterns in the codebase and maintains consistency with existing Assert methods.

Fixes #5764.

3142906741,9875,Improve compatibility error message to include Aspire.Hosting package version,"This PR improves the compatibility error message displayed by the Aspire CLI to show the actual `Aspire.Hosting` package version instead of the `Aspire.Hosting.Sdk` version, which is more relevant for compatibility diagnostics.

## Problem

Previously, when an app host compatibility issue occurred, the error message showed:
```
👎 The app host is not compatible. Consider upgrading the app host or Aspire CLI.

	Aspire Hosting SDK Version: 9.0.0
	Aspire CLI Version: 9.4.0-dev
	Required Capability: SomeCapability
```

This was misleading because the SDK version (9.0.0) didn't reflect the actual `Aspire.Hosting` package version (e.g., 9.4.0) that the user referenced in their project, making it difficult to diagnose compatibility issues.

## Solution

The error message now displays:
```
👎 The app host is not compatible. Consider upgrading the app host or Aspire CLI.

	Aspire.Hosting Version: 9.4.0
	Aspire CLI Version: 9.4.0-dev
	Required Capability: SomeCapability
```

## Implementation Details

- Modified `DotNetCliRunner.GetAppHostInformationAsync()` to use `GetProjectItemsAndPropertiesAsync` to query both MSBuild properties and items
- Added logic to extract the `Aspire.Hosting` version from:
  1. `PackageReference` items (priority)
  2. `AspireProjectOrPackageReference` items (fallback)  
  3. `AspireHostingSDKVersion` property (final fallback for project references)
- Updated error message text from ""Aspire Hosting SDK Version"" to ""Aspire.Hosting Version""
- Updated all related interfaces, method signatures, and parameter names for consistency
- Added comprehensive tests to verify the version detection logic works correctly

## Testing

- All existing CLI tests continue to pass (74/74)
- Added 3 new tests specifically covering package version detection scenarios
- Verified the implementation works with both `PackageReference` and `AspireProjectOrPackageReference` patterns
- Confirmed proper fallback behavior when no package references exist

Fixes #9874.

- `public static T ContainsSingle<T>(Func<T, bool> predicate, IEnumerable<T> collection, [StringSyntax(StringSyntaxAttribute.CompositeFormat)] string? message, params object?[]? parameters)`

## Implementation Details

The new overloads follow the established patterns in the codebase:
- Use `collection.Where(predicate).ToList()` to find matching elements
- Validate exactly one element matches the predicate
- Return the matching element or throw `AssertFailedException` with appropriate error messages
- Support custom message formatting with parameters

## Usage Examples

```csharp
var numbers = new[] { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };

// Find single even number
int even = Assert.ContainsSingle(x => x % 2 == 0 && x > 3, numbers); // Returns 4

// With custom message
var users = new[] { new User(""Alice"", 25), new User(""Bob"", 30) };
User adult = Assert.ContainsSingle(u => u.Age >= 30, users, ""Expected exactly one adult user"");

// With formatted message
Assert.ContainsSingle(x => x.IsActive, items, ""Expected {0} active items, found {1}"", 1, items.Count(x => x.IsActive));
```

## Testing

Added comprehensive test coverage for all scenarios:
- ✅ One matching element (success cases)
- ✅ No matching elements (throws with count 0)
- ✅ Multiple matching elements (throws with actual count)
- ✅ Custom message formatting
- ✅ Complex objects and null values

Fixes #5766.

3277707373,680,Add issue assignment policy to CONTRIBUTING.md,"# Add issue assignment policy to CONTRIBUTING.md

## Summary

Added a note to the CONTRIBUTING.md file stating that issues are not assigned to contributors until they have a history of contributions to the project. This change was requested to enable bots (like Jacquez) that read contributing guidelines to automatically enforce this rule without requiring manual human moderation.

**Changes made:**
- Added one line in the ""Help"" section: ""We don't assign issues to contributors until they have a history of contributions to the project""

## Review & Testing Checklist for Human

- [ ] **Verify the wording** - Confirm that ""history of contributions"" matches the intended policy language
- [ ] **Check placement** - Ensure the Help section is the right location (vs. a more prominent section or dedicated ""Issue Assignment"" section)
- [ ] **Consider visibility** - Determine if this policy should be more prominent given its importance for bot automation

**Test plan:** Review the updated CONTRIBUTING.md file to ensure the addition reads naturally and is discoverable by both humans and bots reading the guidelines.

### Notes

This change supports the automated moderation workflow where bots read CONTRIBUTING.md files to understand project policies and enforce them automatically. The addition is minimal but strategically placed to be discoverable by automated systems.

3118540554,61365,fix(docusaurus): Make entire Card button area clickable,"# Fix Card component button clickable area

## Problem
The clickable area in buttons on the Card component was limited to only the text content. Users had to click precisely on the text to navigate, while clicking on the arrow icon or other parts of the styled button area had no effect.

## Root Cause
The Link component structure had a div container with an anchor tag that only wrapped the text content, leaving the FontAwesome arrow icon outside the clickable area:

```jsx
<div className={`${styles.cardCta} ${linkClass}`}>
  <a href={href}>{children}</a>  // Only text was clickable
  <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faArrowRight} />  // Icon was not clickable
</div>
```

## Solution
Converted the Link component to use a button element with onClick handler that makes the entire styled area clickable:

```jsx
<button className={`${styles.cardCta} ${linkClass}`} onClick={handleClick}>
  {children}
  <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faArrowRight} />
</button>
```

## Changes Made
1. **Card.jsx**: Replaced div+anchor structure with button+onClick pattern
2. **Card.module.css**: Updated CSS to work with button elements:
   - Added `border: none`, `cursor: pointer`, `text-decoration: none` to `.cardCta`
   - Removed anchor-specific styles from `.cardCtaPrimary a` and `.cardCtaSecondary a`
   - Added `background-color: transparent` to `.cardCtaSecondary` for proper styling

## Testing
- Maintains existing visual styling for both primary and secondary button variants
- Preserves href navigation functionality through `window.location.href`
- Follows existing patterns found in other components (RequestERD, Modal)

## Accessibility
- Button element provides proper semantic meaning for interactive elements
- Maintains keyboard navigation support
- Preserves screen reader compatibility

3119551493,354,Remove irs_tax_forms flag from codebase,"# Remove irs_tax_forms flag from codebase

This PR removes the `irs_tax_forms` flag from the Flexile codebase and assumes it is always true for all companies, as requested.

## Changes Made

### Backend Models & Logic

3098904110,60964,docs(enterprise-connectors): Fix version display for enterprise connectors,"# Fix version display for enterprise connectors

## Description
This PR fixes the issue where enterprise connectors display ""custom"" instead of their actual version number in the HeaderDecoration component. The fix modifies the `enterpriseDocsHeaderInformation.js` plugin to:

1. Extract connector type and name from the file path
2. Construct the docker repository name
3. Query the connector registry for version information
4. Fall back to ""custom"" if no version data is found

## Before
Enterprise connector pages showed ""custom"" instead of the actual connector version in the metadata section.

## After
Enterprise connector pages now display the actual version number from the connector registry when available, maintaining ""custom"" as a fallback.

## How I Tested
Built and served the documentation website locally to verify that enterprise connector pages show the correct version.

## Type of Change
- [x] Documentation improvement

3060998787,60252,feat(source-mongodb-v2): Add support for multiple databases,"# Description
This PR adds support for multiple databases in the MongoDB v2 source connector. Previously, the connector only accepted a single database as input, but now it can discover and sync collections from multiple databases.

## Changes
- Modified `spec.json` to add a new `databases` array property while maintaining backward compatibility with the existing `database` property
- Updated `MongoDbSourceConfig.java` to handle multiple databases with a new `getDatabaseNames()` method
- Updated the discovery logic in `MongoDbSource.java` to iterate through all specified databases
- Updated the check method to verify collections across all specified databases
- Updated the full refresh logic to handle streams from multiple databases
- Updated documentation to reflect the new capability

## How has this been tested?
The changes have been tested by:
- Verifying the configuration schema accepts multiple databases
- Ensuring backward compatibility with the existing single database configuration
- Checking that the discovery logic correctly iterates through all specified databases

- Makes the Reference section always appear in connector documentation
- Removes dependency on PyPI publishing status
- Adds fallback message when connector lacks valid spec: ""No configuration specification is available for this connector.""

## Why
Previously, Reference sections were only shown for PyPI-enabled connectors. However, all connectors should have this section to document their configuration, regardless of their implementation language or publishing status.

## How
- Modified specDecoration.js to remove PyPI check
- Added fallback text for connectors without valid specs
- Simplified the logic to always try rendering the Reference section

## Testing
The changes will be validated through CI documentation builds.

3189960764,424,Restrict invoice detail modal access to administrators only,"
# Restrict invoice detail modal access to administrators only

## Summary

Modified the `onRowClicked` prop in the invoices DataTable to conditionally restrict access to invoice detail modals based on user role. Non-administrators can no longer click invoice table rows to open detail modals, while administrators retain full access.

**Changed:**
- `frontend/app/invoices/page.tsx` line 278: `onRowClicked={setDetailInvoice}` → `onRowClicked={user.roles.administrator ? setDetailInvoice : undefined}`

This follows the same conditional pattern already used elsewhere in the file (e.g., `searchColumn` prop on line 279).

## Review & Testing Checklist for Human

- [ ] **Test non-administrator behavior**: Verify that contractors/non-admins cannot click invoice table rows to open detail modals
- [ ] **Test administrator behavior**: Confirm that administrators can still click invoice rows to open detail modals normally  
- [ ] **Check for JavaScript errors**: Ensure no console errors occur when non-administrators click invoice rows
- [ ] **Verify business logic**: Confirm this access restriction aligns with intended invoice management permissions
- [ ] **UI/UX considerations**: Check if non-administrators need visual indication that rows are not clickable

**Recommended Test Plan:**
1. Log in as a non-administrator user and navigate to invoices page
2. Attempt to click various invoice rows - should not open detail modals
3. Log in as an administrator and verify invoice row clicking still works
4. Check browser console for any errors during testing

# fix(source-file): Update proxy unit tests to match environment variable implementation

This PR targets the following PR:
- #62451

---

## Summary

Fixed 6 failing unit tests in `test_proxy_certificate_support.py` by updating them to match the actual proxy implementation. The original tests expected proxy configuration to be passed directly to `smart_open.open()` via `transport_params`, but the actual implementation uses environment variables set by `configure_custom_http_proxy()`.

**Key Changes:**
- Completely rewrote all proxy tests to use `Client` instead of `URLFile` directly
- Replaced assertions checking `transport_params[""proxies""]` with mocks verifying `configure_custom_http_proxy()` calls
- Added new tests for certificate installation and environment variable setup
- Updated test approach from testing implementation details to testing the actual API contract

**Before:** Tests expected `URLFile._open()` to pass proxy config to `smart_open.open(transport_params={""proxies"": {...}})`

**After:** Tests verify that `Client.__init__()` calls `configure_custom_http_proxy()` which sets `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, and certificate environment variables

## Review & Testing Checklist for Human

- [ ] **Verify proxy functionality end-to-end**: The new tests are heavily mocked. Test actual proxy connections manually to ensure the environment variable approach works in practice
- [ ] **Check for lost test coverage**: Review the original failing tests to see if any important edge cases (certificate cleanup, error handling) were removed during the rewrite
- [ ] **Validate environment variable behavior**: Confirm that setting `HTTP_PROXY`/`HTTPS_PROXY` environment variables actually makes the underlying HTTP libraries use the proxy
- [ ] **Test certificate installation**: Verify that custom CA certificates are properly installed and used when both proxy and certificate are configured

**Recommended test plan:**
1. Run the unit tests to ensure they pass
2. Test actual proxy connectivity with the source-file connector using a real proxy server
3. Test certificate validation with a proxy that requires custom CA certificates

### Notes

- All 63 unit tests now pass (previously 6 were failing)
- The proxy implementation uses environment variables rather than direct `smart_open` transport parameters
- Tests now focus on the public API (Client constructor) rather than internal implementation details
- Created by @aaronsteers, implemented in Devin session: https://app.devin.ai/sessions/2ca3b802277a42cf87f2cad685115aae

**⚠️ Important:** While the tests pass, the heavy use of mocks means they may not catch real proxy connectivity issues. Manual testing with actual proxy servers is recommended before merging.

2819377735,3621,fix: correct time formatting for minutes and seconds in cell status,"Fixes #3620

This PR fixes the time formatting in cell status to correctly handle minutes and seconds. The issue was caused by incorrect rounding of minutes and seconds, which has been fixed by:

1. Using Math.floor() instead of toFixed(0) for minutes and seconds
2. Properly handling the conversion from milliseconds to seconds
3. Adding comprehensive tests to verify the behavior

The fix ensures that times are displayed correctly, particularly around minute boundaries (e.g., 1:30 no longer incorrectly rounds to 2:00).

* Add Pendulum as an explicit dependency in pyproject.toml

## Why
The connector was using Pendulum without declaring it as a dependency in pyproject.toml. This change makes the dependency explicit.

## Testing
No tests were modified as this only adds an explicit dependency that was already being used.

## Changes

- Replaced all BigInt literals in frontend TypeScript files with the function call syntax
- Maintained the same semantic meaning while using more explicit syntax
- Focused on files with financial calculations, database schema defaults, and equity-related code

## Motivation

As discussed in Slack, this change improves code consistency and helps prevent confusion for both humans and AI when working with the codebase.

3223746466,520,Add year and month parameters to DividendReportCsvEmailJob,"
# Update DividendReportCsvEmailJob to accept year/month parameters with last month default

## Summary

Modified the `DividendReportCsvEmailJob` to accept optional `year` and `month` parameters while maintaining backward compatibility. The key changes include:

- **Default behavior change**: Job now defaults to last month's data instead of current month
- **Parameter flexibility**: Can now generate reports for specific year/month combinations
- **Enhanced email subject**: Includes year-month in ""yyyy-mm"" format (e.g., ""Flexile Dividend Report CSV 2024-01"")
- **Backward compatibility**: Existing scheduled job continues to work without modification

The job maintains the same core functionality but provides more flexibility for generating historical reports while fixing the default behavior to target completed months.

## Review & Testing Checklist for Human

**⚠️ HIGH RISK ITEMS** (3 items - financial data + date logic + production impact)

- [ ] **Verify default behavior change is correct**: Confirm that defaulting to last month instead of current month is the intended behavior for production use
- [ ] **Test date filtering logic manually**: Run the job with various year/month combinations to ensure the date range filtering works correctly (start_date, end_date logic)
- [ ] **Manual end-to-end testing**: Test both default behavior (no parameters) and explicit year/month parameters in a staging environment to verify CSV generation and email delivery

3224382275,62945,feat(docs): Add Cloud Enterprise product badge,"
# Add Cloud Enterprise product badge with replacement behavior

## Summary

This PR implements a new optional ""Cloud Enterprise"" product badge for the documentation system. The badge appears when `products: cloud-enterprise` is specified in Markdown frontmatter and **replaces** the standard Cloud badge entirely (not appearing alongside it).

**Key changes:**
- Added `cloudEnterprise` variable and conditional rendering logic to ProductInformation component
- Cloud Enterprise badge replaces Cloud badge when `cloud-enterprise` is set (following cloud-teams pattern)
- Updated documentation in 3 files to document the new `cloud-enterprise` option
- Excluded Cloud Enterprise from ""all"" shorthand (requires explicit specification)

**Fix applied:** Initial implementation incorrectly showed both Cloud and Cloud Enterprise badges simultaneously. Fixed to use mutually exclusive conditional rendering.

## Review & Testing Checklist for Human

- [ ] **Test badge replacement behavior**: Create test page with `products: cloud-enterprise` and verify ONLY Cloud Enterprise badge appears (not Cloud badge)
- [ ] **Verify visual styling**: Ensure Cloud Enterprise badge matches existing badge styling and doesn't break layout
- [ ] **Test exclusion from ""all""**: Verify `products: all` does NOT show Cloud Enterprise badge  
- [ ] **Check for regressions**: Test existing cloud-teams behavior still works correctly
- [ ] **Validate documentation accuracy**: Ensure all 3 documentation files correctly describe the new option

**Recommended test plan**: Use Vercel preview to create test pages with different product combinations (`cloud-enterprise`, `all`, `cloud-teams`) and verify badge rendering matches expected behavior.

### Notes


- **Critical fix**: Changed from additive badges (both showing) to replacement behavior (mutually exclusive)
- **Pattern consistency**: Implementation mirrors existing cloud-teams badge pattern exactly
- **Testing limitation**: Unable to visually test due to pre-existing Mermaid build errors - human verification essential
- **Documentation scope**: Updated all versioned documentation to maintain consistency

# Update contractor form to default contractSignedElsewhere from last contractor

## Summary
Updates the contractor invitation form to use the last contractor's `contractSignedElsewhere` value as the default, following the same pattern as other form fields like `payRateInSubunits`, `role`, etc. Also adds an e2e test to verify this pre-filling behavior.

**Changes made:**
- Added `contractSignedElsewhere` to the contractors list query return data in the TRPC router
- Updated form defaults to use `lastContractor?.contractSignedElsewhere ?? false` instead of hardcoded `false`
- Added e2e test to verify checkbox defaults to the last contractor's value

## Review & Testing Checklist for Human
**⚠️ High Priority - Unable to test locally due to environment issues**

- [ ] **Test the actual UI flow**: Create a contractor with ""contract signed elsewhere"" checked, then open the form again and verify the checkbox is pre-filled correctly
- [ ] **Verify the e2e test passes**: Run the specific test `pnpm playwright test e2e/tests/company/administrator/new-contract.spec.ts -g ""pre-fills form with last contractor""` to ensure selectors are correct
- [ ] **Check form field label**: Confirm the checkbox label is actually ""Already signed contract elsewhere"" as assumed in the test
- [ ] **Verify no regressions**: Test that other form pre-filling behavior (pay rate, role, etc.) still works correctly
- [ ] **Test edge cases**: Verify behavior when no contractors exist yet (should default to false)

**Recommended test plan:**
1. Create a contractor with ""contract signed elsewhere"" **checked** → verify next form defaults to checked
2. Create a contractor with ""contract signed elsewhere"" **unchecked** → verify next form defaults to unchecked  
3. Test with no existing contractors → verify form defaults to unchecked
4. Verify other form fields still pre-fill correctly from last contractor

## Summary
Created `.github/copilot-instructions.md` that mirrors all existing cursor rules from `.cursorrules` to ensure consistent AI assistant behavior across both Cursor and GitHub Copilot. Added a synchronization rule to keep both files updated together when new rules are added.

**Added:**
- New file: `.github/copilot-instructions.md` (43 lines)
- Copied all existing cursor rules exactly
- Added meta-rule: ""When adding new rules: Always update both `.cursorrules` and `.github/copilot-instructions.md` to keep them synchronized""

## Review & Testing Checklist for Human
- [ ] **Content verification**: Compare `.github/copilot-instructions.md` with `.cursorrules` line-by-line to ensure exact match (critical for consistency)
- [ ] **Synchronization rule clarity**: Verify the new rule about keeping both files synchronized is clear and actionable
- [ ] **File location**: Confirm `.github/copilot-instructions.md` is the correct location for GitHub Copilot instructions
- [ ] **Copilot behavior test**: Create a test PR or comment to verify GitHub Copilot actually reads and follows these instructions

# Add form inheritance rule to cursor rules and copilot instructions

## Summary
Adds a new development rule to both `.cursorrules` and `.github/copilot-instructions.md` instructing developers that forms for adding new objects to the database should inherit values from the last object added to the table. This follows the pattern demonstrated in PR #433 where the contractor form was updated to inherit `contractSignedElsewhere` from the last contractor.

**Changes made:**
- Added form inheritance rule to both instruction files
- Placed the rule in the feature development section for logical flow
- Used specific examples from PR #433 (contractSignedElsewhere, payRateInSubunits, role, etc.)
- Maintained synchronization between both instruction files

## Review & Testing Checklist for Human
**🟢 Low Risk - Documentation update only**

- [ ] **Verify rule clarity**: Confirm the new rule is clear and actionable for developers to follow
- [ ] **Check file synchronization**: Ensure both `.cursorrules` and `.github/copilot-instructions.md` have identical content
- [ ] **Validate rule placement**: Confirm the rule is logically placed in the feature development section

**Recommended verification:**
- Read through the new rule and confirm it accurately reflects the pattern from PR #433
- Check that the rule provides enough context and examples for developers to understand the expected behavior

# docs(source-snowflake): Address PR feedback - improve grammar, list formatting, heading structure, and table references

## Summary

This PR addresses specific feedback from Ian at Airbyte on the Snowflake source connector documentation, focusing on improving documentation quality and readability. The changes are primarily stylistic and structural, aimed at making the documentation more accessible to data engineers and analysts with average English proficiency.

**Key improvements made:**

1. **Grammar and Word Choice**: Fixed awkward phrasing, added missing articles, improved sentence flow, and corrected punctuation throughout the document
2. **List Formatting**: Restructured the Requirements section to have a proper introduction followed by a clean numbered list, removing explanatory text that was incorrectly placed as the first list item
3. **Heading Structure**: Removed arbitrary numbered headings in the Setup guide and restructured them as proper descriptive subsections
4. **Table References**: Removed references to non-existent ""Step 1"" and ""Step 2"" in the Login and Password table descriptions
5. **Configuration Example**: Replaced JSON configuration example with UI-focused step-by-step instructions for setting up incremental sync

The original comprehensive incremental sync documentation remains intact, including detailed explanations of cursor fields, supported data types, and troubleshooting guidance.

## Review & Testing Checklist for Human

- [ ] **Verify technical accuracy of incremental sync documentation** - Review that all details about cursor fields, data types, and sync mechanics match the actual connector implementation
- [ ] **Check documentation builds successfully** - Run `pnpm clear && pnpm build` from the `/docusaurus` directory to ensure no markdown syntax errors
- [ ] **Validate external links** - Test key links to Snowflake documentation to ensure they're still functional
- [ ] **Confirm readability improvements** - Review that grammar fixes and structural changes improve clarity without losing technical accuracy

### Recommended Test Plan
1. Build the documentation locally and review the rendered output
2. Verify that the incremental sync section provides clear, actionable guidance
3. Check that the UI-focused configuration instructions align with the actual Airbyte interface

3201035188,62515,fix(docs): convert HTML anchor tag to Docusaurus heading reference in Google Sheets destination,"
# Fix HTML anchor tag causing Docusaurus build errors in Google Sheets destination docs

## Summary

This PR resolves HTML minifier diagnostic errors that were occurring during the Docusaurus build process for the Google Sheets destination documentation. The issue was caused by nested anchor tags when using HTML `<a name>` syntax within markdown headings.

**Changes made:**
- Converted `### <a name=""limitations""></a>Limitations` to `### Limitations {#limitations}` 
- This follows Docusaurus best practices for creating linkable headings using the `{#inline-link}` syntax
- The change eliminates the nested anchor tag structure that was causing HTML minifier errors

**Files modified:**
- `docs/integrations/destinations/google-sheets.md` - Line 103

## Review & Testing Checklist for Human

- [ ] **Verify anchor link functionality**: Test that clicking on links to `#limitations` section still works correctly (e.g., from table of contents or external links)
- [ ] **Check for other instances**: Search the documentation for other HTML anchor tags that might need similar conversion
- [ ] **Validate complete build**: Ensure the full Docusaurus build passes without the HTML minifier errors that were previously reported

**Recommended test plan:**
1. Run a local Docusaurus build to verify no HTML minifier errors appear for google-sheets
2. Navigate to the Google Sheets destination documentation and test that the #limitations anchor link works
3. Check if any existing bookmarks or external links to this section still function correctly

### Notes

- **Root cause**: The HTML `<a name=""limitations""></a>` tag was creating nested anchor elements when processed by Docusaurus, causing HTML minifier diagnostic errors at character positions 86457-86460 and 86475-86479
- **Solution approach**: Used Docusaurus-native `{#inline-link}` syntax instead of raw HTML anchor tags, which is the recommended approach per Docusaurus documentation guidelines
- **Verification**: Build output search confirmed that ""google-sheets"" and ""HTML minifier"" errors no longer appear in the build logs

3256237787,615,Move trpc.users.update to Rails controller,"# Move trpc.users.update to Rails controller

## Summary

This PR migrates the `trpc.users.update` mutation from the frontend tRPC router to a new Rails controller in the internal settings namespace. The change removes the tRPC dependency for user updates and consolidates user management logic in the Rails backend.

**Key Changes:**
- Created new `Internal::Settings::UsersController` following existing controller patterns
- Added route to internal settings namespace (`PATCH /internal/settings/users`)
- Updated frontend settings page to use direct fetch calls instead of tRPC mutation
- Removed tRPC `users.update` mutation from the users router
- Maintained existing validation logic by leveraging the `UpdateUser` service

## Review & Testing Checklist for Human

**⚠️ Critical Items (5 items) - Unable to test locally due to environment issues**

- [ ] **End-to-end test**: Navigate to `/settings` page and test updating both email and preferred name fields
- [ ] **Error handling verification**: Test validation errors (email too short <5 chars, preferred name >50 chars) and network errors
- [ ] **Authorization check**: Verify users can only update their own data and proper authentication is enforced
- [ ] **UI state testing**: Confirm loading spinner, success state (""Saved!""), and error states display correctly
- [ ] **Parameter mapping**: Verify frontend JSON payload (`email`, `preferredName`) correctly maps to Rails controller params

**Recommended Test Plan:**
1. Start the application with `bin/dev`
2. Navigate to `/settings` page
3. Test valid updates (short preferred name, valid email)
4. Test validation errors (email < 5 chars, preferred name > 50 chars)
5. Test network error scenarios (disconnect network, test error handling)
6. Verify button states and messages during each interaction

3178933687,414,Remove redundant validation check in invoice service,"
# Remove redundant validation check in invoice service

## Summary

This PR fixes HTTP 422 errors when submitting invoices by removing a redundant validation check in `CreateOrUpdateInvoiceService`. The service was performing an `all_values_present` check that duplicated model-level validations, causing generic ""Please input all values"" errors instead of the more specific model validation messages like ""Invoice line items description can't be blank"".

**Changes made:**
- Removed lines 16-21 in `CreateOrUpdateInvoiceService` containing the redundant `all_values_present` validation
- Updated test expectations in shared example group to expect the actual model validation error message
- Both RSpec test failures are now resolved

## Review & Testing Checklist for Human

- [ ] **Verify model validations are sufficient** - Confirm that `InvoiceLineItem` model validations properly handle all the validation cases that were previously covered by the service-level check
- [ ] **Test invoice submission end-to-end** - Submit an invoice with missing/empty description field via the frontend to ensure the error message is user-friendly and actionable
- [ ] **Check for other dependencies** - Search codebase for any other places that might expect or handle the ""Please input all values"" error message
- [ ] **Verify error message consistency** - Ensure the new error message ""Invoice line items description can't be blank"" matches the pattern of other validation errors in the system

**Recommended test plan:** Try submitting the original failing invoice payload `{""invoice"":{""invoice_date"":""2025-06-26""},""invoice_line_items"":[{""description"":""-"",""pay_rate_in_subunits"":1200000,""quantity"":1,""hourly"":false}]}` and verify it now returns a helpful error message instead of HTTP 422 with generic text.

### Notes

- The Playwright test failure in CI is unrelated to this change (tax settings UI issue)
- This change should improve user experience by providing more specific error messages
- The removed validation was checking `item.values.all?(&:present?)` which was too broad and prevented proper model validation errors from surfacing

3167827984,402,Fix desktop layout in CardContent on invoices page,"# Fix desktop layout in CardContent on invoices page

This PR fixes the desktop layout issue in the `CardContent` component on the `/invoices` page where form fields were stacking vertically instead of displaying in the intended two-column layout.

## Changes Made

- Changed grid layout from `lg:grid-cols-[1fr_auto_1fr]` to `lg:grid-cols-2` for consistent two-column desktop layout
- Moved equity compensation field into the left column alongside other form fields (Rate, Hours/Qty, Invoice date)
- Removed separators that were designed for the problematic three-column layout
- Ensures layout works consistently whether equity compensation is enabled or disabled

## Problem Solved

The original three-column grid layout (`lg:grid-cols-[1fr_auto_1fr]`) was breaking when the equity compensation section was conditionally rendered. When equity compensation was disabled, there were only two elements in a three-column grid, causing improper alignment and vertical stacking instead of the intended horizontal layout.

## Testing

- ✅ Lint checks passed with no ESLint warnings or errors
- ⚠️ Local testing was limited due to Redis connection issues in the development environment
- Layout changes are straightforward CSS grid modifications that should work as expected

## Screenshots

Before: Form fields stacked vertically
After: Two-column layout with form fields on left, total amount on right (as intended in design)

3169159305,403,Remove company details step from administrator onboarding,"# Remove company details step from administrator onboarding

## Summary
Removed the ""Set up your company"" step from the administrator onboarding flow as requested. The company details form fields (legal name, street address, city, state, ZIP code) are now collected in the administrator settings details page instead.

## Changes Made
- ✅ Removed ""Company details"" from the onboarding steps array in `frontend/app/companies/[companyId]/administrator/onboarding/index.ts`
- ✅ Deleted the entire company details onboarding page directory (`frontend/app/companies/[companyId]/administrator/onboarding/details/`)
- ✅ Updated administrator settings details page to include company address fields that were previously in onboarding
- ✅ Removed the e2e test file for the deleted onboarding step
- ✅ Updated form validation and field labels to match the original onboarding form

## Technical Details
- The onboarding flow now goes directly from ""Signup"" to ""Bank account"" (2 steps instead of 3)
- Company address fields are now collected via the TRPC `companies.update` mutation in settings
- The settings page already had the necessary backend support for these fields
- Maintained consistent form validation and user experience

## Testing
- [x] Code compiles without errors
- [x] Git history is clean with descriptive commit message
- [ ] Manual testing of onboarding flow (requires local dev environment)
- [ ] Manual testing of administrator settings page (requires local dev environment)

3057663648,60225,refactor(connectors): move version increment check to connectors_qa package,"# Description
This PR moves the Version Increment Check from the Airbyte CI Pipelines package to the Connector QA package, implementing it as a new QA check.

I didn't change any of the Version Inc Check implementation as it exists as part of the Airbyte CI package ([see here](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/blob/38f144d1056bd9749fd24afc8f359e436e471f33/airbyte-ci/connectors/pipelines/pipelines/airbyte_ci/connectors/test/steps/common.py)). Essentially, now there are two implementations of the same check. Eventually, we may choose to delete stuff in Airbyte CI, but I am holding off for now. The downside of this change is that Airbyte CI will now run the version increment check logic twice. Once as a standalone step and again as part of the qa check step. (This is technically remediable by specified explicitly which qa checks are run but I want to avoid modifying Airbyte CI code.

## How to test
To run the version increment check on a connector through connectors-qa. This assumes you have the connectors-qa CLI installed (see README for those instructions).

```bash
connectors-qa run -c CheckVersionIncrement --name source-google-sheets
```

## TODOs:
figure out how to implement two pieces of conditional check-skipping logic that exist in the existing version check implementation - it's possible we would want to introduce these more broadly to our new Connector CI workflows or potentially not at all.
- don't run the check if the only files modified for the connector are part of a list of excluded files (e.g. test files) [see example](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/blob/4cd711290c6819eac6f5c158f1ed49391f4aad90/airbyte-ci/connectors/pipelines/pipelines/airbyte_ci/connectors/test/steps/common.py#L121)
- don't run the check on the master branch (we would expect a check failure in this case)

3084414634,324,Fix: Allow workers to add expenses when creating new invoices,"# Allow workers to add expenses when creating new invoices

## Changes
- Modified the condition in `Edit.tsx` to show the ""Add expense"" button for workers when company has expenses enabled
- Added a test to verify that workers can add expenses when clicking the ""New invoice"" button

## Testing
- Added e2e test to verify the functionality
- Test confirms that the ""Add expense"" button is visible when expenses are enabled

## Implementation Details
The key change is inverting the condition from `canManageExpenses` to `!canManageExpenses`. The `canManageExpenses` variable is defined as `showExpenses || expenses.size > 0`, which means it's true when expenses are shown or when there are existing expenses.

The new condition `data.company.expenses.enabled && !canManageExpenses` will show the ""Add expense"" button when:
1. The company has expenses enabled
2. The user doesn't already have expenses shown or existing expenses

This ensures that workers can add expenses when creating a new invoice, which is the desired behavior.

# Fix spelling error in Connector Builder incremental sync documentation

## Summary

This PR addresses a technical review of PR #63329 for inaccuracies in Connector Builder UI documentation. After systematically cross-referencing all 11 documentation files against the actual UI implementation and declarative component schema, I found only one issue: a spelling error in `incremental-sync.md` where ""fullfil"" should be ""fulfill"".

**Review process completed:**
- ✅ Cross-referenced all UI labels against `airbyte-platform-internal/oss/airbyte-webapp/src/locales/en.json`
- ✅ Verified pagination terminology matches schema definitions (""Offset Increment"", ""Page Increment"", ""Cursor Pagination"")
- ✅ Confirmed authentication method labels match exactly with UI implementation
- ✅ Searched for outdated basic/advanced mode references (none found)
- ✅ Verified technical accuracy against `declarative_component_schema.yaml`

## Review & Testing Checklist for Human

**Risk Level: 🟢 GREEN (Very Low Risk)**

- [ ] Verify the spelling correction from ""fullfil"" to ""fulfill"" is correct
- [ ] Confirm this change targets the correct branch (`13167-docs-connector-builder-new-ui-schemaform-rollout`)
- [ ] Spot-check that my review didn't miss any obvious technical inaccuracies in the other documentation files

# Fix README vercel env pull command to include .env filename

## Summary
Fixed inconsistency between README.md and bin/setup script for the Vercel environment pull command. Changed `pnpx vercel env pull` to `pnpx vercel env pull .env` in the README to match the actual command used in the setup script.

This change was requested based on team discussion where it was identified that:
- The README showed the incorrect command without the `.env` filename
- The `bin/setup` script already uses the correct command with `.env` 
- Using `.env.local` (the default) gets ignored by tests, which is why `.env` is preferred

## Review & Testing Checklist for Human
- [ ] Verify the README command now matches the bin/setup script command (line 44)
- [ ] Confirm this aligns with the team's preferred approach for environment setup

3255989855,614,Implement conditional user ID logic in dashboard layout,"# Implement conditional user ID logic in dashboard layout

## Summary

This PR implements conditional user ID passing in the dashboard layout's documents query to match the pattern used in the documents page. Previously, the layout was always passing `user.id` to the documents query for all users. Now it only passes the user ID when the user is not an administrator or lawyer.

**Key Changes:**
- Added `isCompanyRepresentative` check (`!!user.roles.administrator || !!user.roles.lawyer`)
- Created conditional `userId` variable that is `null` for admins/lawyers, `user.id` for others
- Updated documents query in layout to use conditional `userId` instead of always passing `user.id`

This ensures consistency between the sidebar document badge count and the documents page filtering behavior.

Closes #605

## Review & Testing Checklist for Human

- [ ] **Test document badge counts**: Verify that admins/lawyers see different badge counts than regular users in the sidebar navigation
- [ ] **Test role switching**: Switch between admin, lawyer, and regular user roles to verify the document badge updates correctly and consistently
- [ ] **Cross-reference behavior**: Confirm the sidebar badge count matches the document count shown on the documents page for the same user role

# Fix incremental sync UI terminology based on user feedback

## Summary

Updated the Airbyte Connector Builder incremental sync documentation to use more generic, user-friendly terminology instead of specific UI labels that may not be visible or prominent to users. Based on feedback from Ian Alton that the labels ""Cursor datetime formats"" and ""API time filtering capabilities"" were not visible in the actual Connector Builder Advanced mode interface, despite being present in the code and localization strings.

**Key Changes:**
- Changed ""Cursor datetime formats"" → ""Datetime formats""
- Changed ""API time filtering capabilities"" → ""Time filtering mode""
- Updated section headers and all references throughout the document
- Updated the Guardian API example to use the corrected terminology

The goal is to make the documentation more accessible by using descriptive terminology that accurately describes the functionality without referencing specific UI labels that users may not see or recognize.

## Review & Testing Checklist for Human

- [ ] **Verify actual UI labels** - Check the Connector Builder Advanced mode interface to confirm what labels users actually see for datetime formats and time filtering settings
- [ ] **Test documentation rendering** - Ensure the documentation builds and renders correctly with the terminology changes (build failed during testing due to unrelated Mermaid issues)
- [ ] **Validate terminology accuracy** - Confirm that the new generic terms (""Datetime formats"", ""Time filtering mode"") accurately reflect the user experience
- [ ] **Check for missed references** - Search for any remaining references to the old terminology that may have been missed
- [ ] **Test Guardian API example** - Verify that the updated example still makes sense with the new terminology

**Recommended Test Plan:**
1. Open the Connector Builder UI in Advanced mode
2. Navigate to the incremental sync configuration section
3. Compare the actual UI labels with the documentation terminology
4. Create a test connector using the Guardian API example to verify the instructions are accurate

# docs(connector-builder): Update partitioning documentation for advanced mode UI

## Summary

This PR completely rewrites the Connector Builder partitioning documentation to reflect the current schema-driven UI implementation. The key changes include:

- **Unified approach**: Replaced outdated ""Parameterized Requests"" and ""Parent Stream"" component references with a single ""Partition Router"" section that matches the current UI
- **Complete coverage**: Added documentation for all four partition router types (ListPartitionRouter, SubstreamPartitionRouter, CustomPartitionRouter, GroupingPartitionRouter) 
- **Schema alignment**: Updated field names and configuration options to match `declarative_component_schema.yaml`
- **Advanced features**: Added documentation for previously undocumented features like `extra_fields`, `lazy_read_pointer`, and `incremental_dependency`
- **Mode cleanup**: Removed all references to basic/advanced mode distinction as requested
- **Improved structure**: Reorganized content with clearer examples and better explanation of when to use each router type

## Review & Testing Checklist for Human

This is a major documentation rewrite with moderate risk. Please verify:

- [ ] **Field names accuracy**: Open the Connector Builder UI and verify that all field names, labels, and configuration options in the documentation exactly match what users see in the partition router section
- [ ] **All router types work**: Test configuring each of the four partition router types (List, Substream, Custom, Grouping) to ensure the documented fields and behaviors are correct
- [ ] **Examples are functional**: Try the SurveySparrow and WooCommerce examples to verify they work as described with the current UI
- [ ] **Advanced features exist**: Verify that advanced features like `extra_fields`, `lazy_read_pointer`, and `incremental_dependency` are actually available in the UI and work as documented
- [ ] **No missing functionality**: Compare with the original documentation to ensure no critical features or use cases were accidentally omitted

**Recommended test plan**: Create a test connector using each partition router type and verify the documentation accurately describes the configuration process and resulting behavior.

# Update Connector Builder error handling documentation for schema-driven UI

## Summary

This PR comprehensively updates the Connector Builder error handling documentation to reflect the current schema-driven UI implementation. The changes remove all references to basic/advanced mode (as advanced mode is now the standard) and ensure all documented features are technically accurate based on the `declarative_component_schema.yaml`.

**Key changes:**
- **Expanded error handler types**: Added documentation for Default, Composite, and Custom error handlers
- **Enhanced backoff strategies**: Added missing configuration options (regex, min_wait, max_waiting_time_in_seconds, factor) with examples
- **Rewrote response filters section**: Updated to include all available actions (SUCCESS, RETRY, IGNORE, FAIL, RATE_LIMITED) and conditions
- **Added advanced configuration**: Documented max_retries, failure_type, and custom error messages with interpolation
- **Added practical guidance**: Common error handling patterns, best practices, and troubleshooting guide
- **Removed mode references**: Eliminated all basic/advanced mode language as requested

The documentation now provides in-depth coverage suitable for technical users building connectors, with all features verifiable against the authoritative schema definitions.

## Review & Testing Checklist for Human

- [ ] **Verify schema accuracy**: Cross-reference all documented properties against `airbyte-python-cdk/airbyte_cdk/sources/declarative/declarative_component_schema.yaml` to ensure they exist and are described correctly
- [ ] **Check for missed mode references**: Search the updated documentation for any remaining ""basic mode"", ""advanced mode"", or conditional language about feature availability
- [ ] **Test documentation build**: Run `pnpm install && pnpm clear && pnpm build` in the docusaurus directory to verify the changes don't break the build
- [ ] **Validate examples**: Verify that the YAML examples and API response examples are technically accurate and follow current schema requirements
- [ ] **UI alignment check**: Compare the documented features with the actual Connector Builder UI to ensure the documentation matches what users will see

**Recommended test plan**: Review the error handling page at the preview URL, then test a few error handler configurations in the actual Connector Builder UI to verify the documented options are available and work as described.

3037528207,256,Reduce vertical padding on mobile homepage,"# Reduce vertical padding on mobile homepage

## What changed
- Reduced the vertical padding on all sections of the mobile homepage from 4rem (64px) to 2rem (32px)
- Maintained the existing 4rem (64px) padding on desktop/larger screens
- Used Tailwind's responsive utility classes to apply different padding based on screen size

## Why
The vertical padding on mobile was too large, taking up excessive space on smaller screens. This change improves the mobile experience by making better use of the limited screen real estate.

## Testing
- Tested on mobile viewport using browser developer tools
- Verified the reduced padding on mobile
- Confirmed padding remains unchanged on desktop

3244292653,589,Update tagline from 'Equity for everyone' to 'Contractor payments as easy as 1-2-3',"# Update tagline from 'Equity for everyone' to 'Contractor payments as easy as 1-2-3'

## Summary

This PR updates the main project tagline from ""Equity for everyone"" to ""Contractor payments as easy as 1-2-3"" across the codebase. The changes were made in two key locations:

- **README.md** (line 6): Updated the main project tagline
- **frontend/app/layout.tsx** (line 20): Updated the metadata description that appears in browser tabs and search results

These are simple text replacements that align the project messaging with the new ""Contractor payments as easy as 1-2-3"" positioning.

## Review & Testing Checklist for Human

**⚠️ Important**: I was unable to test these changes locally due to environment setup issues (Vercel CLI errors and Node version mismatch), so human verification is essential.

- [ ] **Verify the new tagline displays correctly**: Check that the marketing page and other user-facing areas show ""Contractor payments as easy as 1-2-3"" instead of the old text
- [ ] **Confirm page metadata updated**: Check browser tab title and page description show the new text
- [ ] **Test core functionality**: Ensure the frontend loads properly and no functionality was broken by these changes
- [ ] **Search for missed instances**: Do a quick search to confirm no other instances of ""Equity for everyone"" remain in source files

**Recommended test plan**: 
1. Start the development server locally
2. Visit the marketing page (/) and verify the new tagline appears
3. Check browser tab title shows new description
4. Navigate through a few key pages to ensure nothing is broken

3245333569,590,Remove helper widget from all pages,"# Remove helper widget from all pages

## Summary

This PR completely removes the helper widget functionality from all pages in the Flexile application as requested. The helper widget was a support/help component that appeared across the application and has been replaced by a support center.

**Key changes:**
- **Backend**: Removed `HelperWidget` concern from `ApplicationController` and deleted helper widget template and concern files
- **Frontend**: Removed `HelperWrapper` component from the main layout and deleted the component file
- **Configuration**: Cleaned up helper widget environment variables and CSP configuration
- **Documentation**: Removed helper widget documentation

The removal is comprehensive and affects both the rendering logic and configuration across the full stack.

## Review & Testing Checklist for Human

**🔴 Critical (3 items)**
- [ ] **Manual application testing**: Load the application and verify that no helper widget appears on any pages (login, dashboard, contractor flows, etc.)
- [ ] **CSP configuration verification**: Test that the Content Security Policy changes don't break any third-party integrations, embedded content, or API calls
- [ ] **Environment variable impact**: Verify that the application builds and deploys correctly without `HELPER_WIDGET_HOST` and `HELPER_HMAC_SECRET` environment variables

**⚠️ Important (2 items)**
- [ ] **Search for missed references**: Do a codebase search for any remaining references to ""helper"", ""widget"", or ""HelperWidget"" that may have been missed
- [ ] **Failing RSpec test investigation**: Confirm that the failing `InviteWorker` test exists on main branch and is unrelated to these changes (test failure appears to be pre-existing)

**Test plan recommendation**: Test core user flows (contractor onboarding, payment setup, document signing) to ensure helper widget removal doesn't affect primary functionality.

3163760643,389,Remove gumroad_user_id column from dividend_payments table,"# Remove gumroad_user_id column from dividend_payments table

## Summary
This PR removes the unused `gumroad_user_id` column from the `dividend_payments` table as requested. The column appears to be legacy code that was added during the initial table creation but has no active usage in the application.

## Changes Made
- ✅ Created Rails migration to remove `gumroad_user_id` column from `dividend_payments` table
- ✅ Added `ignored_columns` to `DividendPayment` model for safe column removal following Rails best practices
- ✅ Updated backend `schema.rb` to remove column definition
- ✅ Updated frontend `schema.ts` to remove `gumroadUserId` field definition

## Verification
- ✅ Comprehensive search confirmed no active code references to this column in the application
- ✅ The `DividendPayment` model and related services do not use this field
- ✅ Column only appears as `nil` values in test logs, confirming it's unused

## Testing
- [ ] Will run `bin/lint` to verify code quality
- [ ] Will test application startup to ensure no runtime errors

## Migration Strategy
Following Rails best practices for safe column removal:
1. Add column to `ignored_columns` in the model ✅
2. Deploy changes ⏳
3. Remove column via migration ✅

3163779556,390,feat: redirect authenticated users from homepage to dashboard,"# Redirect authenticated users from homepage to dashboard

## Summary
This PR implements automatic redirection for authenticated users visiting the Flexile homepage (https://flexile.com) to the dashboard (https://flexile.com/dashboard), while preserving the marketing page experience for unauthenticated users.

## Changes Made
- Added redirect logic to the marketing homepage component (`frontend/app/(marketing)/page.tsx`)
- Used the same authentication pattern as the auth layout for consistency
- Added necessary imports: `redirect`, `RedirectType`, `useEffect`, and `useUserStore`
- Implemented `useEffect` hook that checks user state and redirects authenticated users

## Implementation Details
- Follows the exact same pattern used in `frontend/app/(auth)/layout.tsx` for consistency
- Uses `RedirectType.replace` to avoid adding the marketing page to browser history
- The `useEffect` dependency on `[user]` ensures redirect triggers when user state changes
- Existing navigation already shows different content for signed-in users, but this ensures they never see marketing content

## Testing
- Linting passed successfully with no ESLint warnings or errors
- Code follows existing patterns and authentication flow in the codebase
- The `/dashboard` route already handles complex logic for determining final user destination based on role and onboarding status

3163802623,392,Allow invoice submission for contractors with contractSignedElsewhere=true,"# Allow invoice submission for contractors with contractSignedElsewhere=true

## Summary
This PR updates the Flexile web app to allow contractors with `contractSignedElsewhere = true` to always submit invoices, bypassing any contract signing requirements or UI blocks.

## Changes Made
- **Added new TRPC query**: `getContractorInfo` in `frontend/trpc/routes/users/index.ts` to expose the `contractSignedElsewhere` field from the contractor record
- **Modified `useCanSubmitInvoices` hook**: Updated the logic in `frontend/app/invoices/index.tsx` to check the `contractSignedElsewhere` flag and bypass contract validation when true
- **Updated return values**: The hook now returns `unsignedContractId: null` when `contractSignedElsewhere` is true, effectively removing the ""unsigned contract"" warning

## Technical Details
The `contractSignedElsewhere` field already exists in the database schema and TRPC context but wasn't exposed to the frontend. This implementation:

1. Adds a simple TRPC query to expose this field to the frontend
2. Modifies the `useCanSubmitInvoices` hook to check this field
3. When `contractSignedElsewhere` is true, the hook bypasses contract signing requirements
4. Maintains backward compatibility for contractors without this flag

## Testing
- ✅ Lint checks passed with no ESLint warnings or errors
- 🔄 Local testing in progress (development server configuration issues)
- 🔄 End-to-end tests pending

## Expected Behavior
- Contractors with `contractSignedElsewhere = true` will not see the ""You have an unsigned contract"" message
- The ""Create invoice"" button will be enabled for these contractors
- Invoice submission will be allowed regardless of unsigned contract status when this flag is true
- Regular contractors without this flag will continue to see contract signing requirements

3274013426,663,Remove time_entries table and all associated code,"# Remove time_entries table and all associated code

## Summary

This PR completely removes the `time_entries` feature from the Flexile codebase as requested. The removal includes:

- **Database migration** to drop the `time_entries` table
- **Model deletion**: Removed `TimeEntry` model and all associations
- **Admin interface cleanup**: Removed controller, dashboard, and routes
- **Frontend cleanup**: Removed auto-generated route helpers
- **Test cleanup**: Removed specs and association tests
- **Service cleanup**: Removed time_entries references from data purge service

The migration has been successfully run in development and the table has been dropped. All code references have been systematically identified and removed.

## Review & Testing Checklist for Human

- [ ] **Run the migration locally** - Verify `rails db:migrate` executes without errors and properly drops the table
- [ ] **Test admin interface** - Navigate to `/admin` and verify all pages load without errors, especially user and company detail pages
- [ ] **Run full test suite** - Execute complete test suite to catch any missed references that cause failures
- [ ] **Search verification** - Perform additional search for `time_entries`, `TimeEntry`, `time_entry` to confirm no references were missed
- [ ] **Frontend compilation** - Verify frontend builds and loads without route helper errors

**Recommended Test Plan**: Start local development server, navigate through admin interface (users, companies, settings), and verify no time_entries related errors appear in logs or UI.

- **Local test failures**: The local RSpec tests failed broadly (not just time_entries related), suggesting potential environment issues that didn't affect the actual migration
- **Auto-generated routes**: Frontend route helpers appear to be auto-generated, so manual removal may need verification

3274013683,664,Remove user_leads table and all associated code via migration,"# Remove user_leads table and all associated code via migration

## Summary

This PR completely removes the `user_leads` functionality from the codebase, including the database table and all associated Rails code. The `user_leads` table appeared to be a simple email collection system with no foreign key relationships, making it safe to remove.

**Key changes:**
- Created Rails migration to drop the `user_leads` table
- Removed UserLead model, admin/API controllers, and admin dashboard
- Removed all test files and factories for user_leads
- Updated routes configuration to remove user_leads endpoints from both admin and API namespaces  
- Removed frontend schema definition for userLeads table
- Fixed CORS system test that referenced the removed API endpoint
- Cleaned up reference in old migration file

## Review & Testing Checklist for Human

**⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY - Please verify these items before merging:**

- [ ] **Verify user_leads table is safe to remove** - Check production database to ensure no critical data will be lost
- [ ] **Test migration in staging environment first** - Run the migration on a copy of production data to ensure it executes successfully
- [ ] **Verify application functionality** - Test the admin dashboard and API to ensure no broken functionality after removal
- [ ] **Review CORS test change** - The test was changed from `POST api_v1_user_leads_path` to `GET root_path` - verify this maintains equivalent test coverage
- [ ] **Double-check for remaining references** - Search codebase for any dynamic references to user_leads that might have been missed

**Recommended test plan:**
1. Run migration on staging with production data copy
2. Test admin dashboard navigation and functionality  
3. Test API endpoints to ensure no 500 errors
4. Run full test suite to catch any missed dependencies

# Update payment UI for failed payments

## Summary
Updates the payment button text and success message based on Slack request from sahil.lavingia@gmail.com:
- **Pay button text**: Changes from ""Pay now"" to ""Pay again"" for invoices with `failed` status
- **Success message**: Changes from ""Payment sent!"" to ""Payment initiated"" for all payment operations

The changes are implemented in the `ApproveButton` component, using conditional logic based on `invoice.status === ""failed""`. E2e tests were added to verify the button text behavior and then simplified based on GitHub feedback to focus only on positive assertions.

## Review & Testing Checklist for Human
- [ ] **Test failed payment UI**: Verify that invoices with failed status actually display ""Pay again"" button text in the live application
- [ ] **Test non-failed payment UI**: Confirm that regular payable invoices still show ""Pay now"" button text
- [ ] **Verify payment status logic**: Confirm that `invoice.status === ""failed""` is the correct way to detect failed payments vs other failure detection methods in the codebase
- [ ] **Test payment flow end-to-end**: Execute a payment and verify the success message shows ""Payment initiated"" instead of ""Payment sent!""
- [ ] **Check for other payment buttons**: Search for any other payment-related UI components that might need similar text updates

**Recommended test plan**: Navigate to the invoices page, find or create invoices with different statuses (failed, received, approved), and verify the button text displays correctly for each case. Then complete a payment flow to verify the success message change.

2. Removed hardcoded signatures from individual templates:
   - ""Stay Salty"" LMNT custom signature from dividend issued email
   - ""Best, Sahil, CEO of Flexile"" signature from invite company email
   - ""Best, The Flexile Team"" signature from various email templates

## Testing
The changes maintain the paragraph structure to preserve email layout while removing all signature content.

3216254194,476,Hide company logo when name is null/empty and add settings navigation,"
# Hide company logo when name is null/empty and add settings navigation

## Summary
Modified the `CompanyName` component in the navigation sidebar to conditionally render the company logo only when `company.name` exists (is truthy). When the logo is displayed, it becomes clickable and navigates to the `/settings` page. The company name text continues to display regardless of logo visibility.

**Key changes:**
- Added conditional rendering around the logo: `{company.name && (...)}`
- Wrapped the `Image` component in a `Link` pointing to `/settings`
- Company name text remains visible even when logo is hidden

## Review & Testing Checklist for Human
- [ ] **Test with companies that have names vs null/empty names** - Verify logo shows/hides correctly
- [ ] **Verify logo click navigation** - Click the logo and confirm it navigates to the correct settings page
- [ ] **Check visual layout** - Ensure the component looks correct in both logo-visible and logo-hidden states
- [ ] **Confirm settings route** - Verify `/settings` is the intended settings page destination

**⚠️ Note**: I was unable to test these changes locally due to Vercel configuration issues with `bin/dev`. Manual testing is critical.

3250855135,63713,fix(source-snowflake): revert base image from 2.0.3 to 2.0.2 to fix certificate errors,"## What
This PR reverts the source-snowflake connector's base image from `java-connector-base:2.0.3` back to `2.0.2` to resolve SSL certificate errors that users have been experiencing since version 1.0.2.

Multiple users have reported certificate errors like:
```
JDBC driver internal error: Max retry reached for the download of chunk#0 (Total chunks: 1) retry: 7, 
error: net.snowflake.client.jdbc.SnowflakeSQLLoggedException: JDBC driver encountered communication error. 
Message: No trusted certificate found
```

The issue was traced to the base image upgrade from 2.0.2 to 2.0.3 in version 1.0.2, where the ca-certificates package was updated from `2023.2.68-1.0.amzn2023.0.1` to `2025.2.76-1.0.amzn2023.0.1`.

## How
- Reverted `baseImage` in `metadata.yaml` from `docker.io/airbyte/java-connector-base:2.0.3@sha256:119b8506...` to `docker.io/airbyte/java-connector-base:2.0.2@sha256:f8e47304...`
- Bumped connector version from 1.0.2 to 1.0.3 to reflect this change

## Review guide
1. `airbyte-integrations/connectors/source-snowflake/metadata.yaml` - Verify the SHA256 hash for 2.0.2 base image is correct
2. Confirm this is the only file that needs updating for base image changes
3. Test that the reverted connector actually resolves the SSL certificate issues

## User Impact
**Positive:**
- Users experiencing SSL certificate errors with Snowflake connections should be able to connect successfully again
- Existing working connections should continue to function normally

**Potential negative:**
- Any security updates from the 2.0.3 base image will be lost until the certificate issue is properly resolved in a future base image

## Can this PR be safely reverted and rolled back?
- [x] YES 💚 

This change simply reverts to a previously working base image version, so it can be safely rolled back if needed.

**Requested by:** yue.li@airbyte.io

**Note for reviewers:** This change was made based on Slack reports that pinning to version 1.0.1 resolved the issue. The base image was the only change between 1.0.1 and 1.0.2, making this the most likely root cause. However, the fix has not been tested in this session.

3233690931,63320,docs(connector-builder): Update async streams documentation for Advanced mode UI,"
# Update async streams documentation for Advanced mode UI

## Summary

Updated the Connector Builder UI async streams documentation to reflect the current schema-driven form implementation. The changes include:

- **Updated field descriptions** to match actual UI implementation with precise field paths (e.g., `retriever.creation_requester.url`)
- **Enhanced configuration sections** for Creation, Polling, and Download tabs with comprehensive field coverage
- **Updated examples** (SendGrid) to use current field names and structure
- **Expanded best practices** with schema validation and testing guidance
- **Ensured Advanced mode focus** with no basic/advanced mode terminology
- **Removed extraneous sections** per reviewer feedback (schema-driven architecture details)

The documentation now accurately reflects the three-tab UI structure (Creation, Polling, Download) used in Advanced mode.

## Review & Testing Checklist for Human

**Risk Level: 🟡 Medium** - Technical accuracy depends on UI implementation details

- [ ] **Verify field paths match actual UI**: Open Connector Builder, create an async stream, and confirm the documented field paths (like `retriever.creation_requester.url`) exactly match what appears in the form labels/structure
- [ ] **Test SendGrid example**: Verify the updated SendGrid API configuration example still works with the current SendGrid API endpoints and field structure  
- [ ] **Verify documentation builds**: Confirm the markdown renders correctly without formatting issues (local build had pre-existing React errors)

**Recommended test plan**: Create a new async stream in Connector Builder UI using the documented field configurations to verify the instructions work end-to-end.

# Replace technical field names with user-facing UI labels in Stream Templates documentation

## Summary

This PR addresses Ian's feedback about the Stream Templates documentation using internal code names instead of user-friendly labels that users actually see in the Connector Builder UI. The changes focus on what users actually interact with rather than exposing technical implementation details.

**Key changes:**
- Replaced ""Available UI Fields"" section to use actual UI labels instead of technical field paths like `retriever.requester.path`
- Removed resolver type sections that used technical class names (HttpComponentsResolver, ConfigComponentsResolver, ParametrizedComponentsResolver) and replaced with user-friendly approach descriptions
- Removed `use_parent_parameters` section as it's a technical implementation detail not visible to users
- Removed ""Experimental Feature"" bullet point as specifically requested
- Updated terminology from ""Fetch Data for Template"" to ""Produce Data for Template"" to match UI

## Review & Testing Checklist for Human

- [ ] **Verify UI label accuracy** - Test in the Connector Builder that the labels I used (URL Path, HTTP Method, Authentication, Record Selector, Components Mapping) actually match what's displayed for stream templates
- [ ] **Test documentation completeness** - Ensure the documentation still provides sufficient technical depth after removing resolver type sections - users may need to understand different approaches available
- [ ] **Test the GitHub Issues API example** - Follow the step-by-step guide to ensure it still accurately reflects the current UI and workflow
- [ ] **Check if removal was too aggressive** - Consider whether the resolver type sections should have been rewritten with user-friendly language instead of completely removed

### Notes


- This work was requested by Ian Alton (ian.alton@airbyte.io) to address specific GitHub feedback on PR #63321
- Changes were made based on investigation of UI code, localization files, and schema definitions, but **the actual UI was not directly tested**
- The documentation build had pre-existing React context errors unrelated to these changes
- **Risk**: I may have overcorrected by removing entire sections instead of rewriting them with user-friendly language

# docs(connector-builder): Update tutorial to remove basic/advanced mode references

## Summary

Updated the Connector Builder UI tutorial documentation to remove all references to basic/advanced mode toggle, as advanced mode will become the standard UI without user choice. The changes focus on:

- **Removing basic/advanced mode terminology** throughout the document
- **Updating section headings** to be mode-agnostic (""Initial configuration"", ""Stream configuration"") 
- **Correcting UI terminology** to match current implementation (Testing Values, Global Configuration, etc.)
- **Fixing grammar and spelling issues** while maintaining tutorial scope and integrity
- **Adding Stream Templates and Asynchronous Job Stream links** to Next steps section (requested in GitHub comment)

This PR targets the `13167-docs-connector-builder-new-ui-schemaform-rollout` branch as part of the schema-driven UI rollout.

## Review & Testing Checklist for Human

- [ ] **UI terminology verification**: Confirm all button labels, section names, and UI elements match exactly what users see in the current Connector Builder interface (this is the highest risk area)
- [ ] **End-to-end tutorial testing**: Follow the tutorial steps from start to finish to ensure they work correctly with the current UI and produce the expected results
- [ ] **Complete mode reference removal**: Search for any remaining references to ""basic"", ""advanced"", or ""mode"" that might have been missed
- [ ] **Tutorial flow coherence**: Verify the tutorial steps still flow logically after removing mode-specific language
- [ ] **Grammar/spelling accuracy**: Review the language changes to ensure no new errors were introduced

**Recommended test plan**: Create a test connector following the tutorial steps exactly as written, using the current Connector Builder UI to verify all instructions are accurate and the connector works as expected.

3137901992,363,Remove cap_table_uploads feature completely,"# Remove cap_table_uploads feature completely

This PR completely removes the cap_table_uploads feature from the Flexile codebase as requested.

## Changes Made

### Backend Changes
- **Modified** `backend/app/models/company.rb` - Removed `has_many :cap_table_uploads` association
- **Modified** `backend/spec/models/company_spec.rb` - Removed cap_table_uploads association test
- **Modified** `backend/db/schema.rb` - Removed cap_table_uploads table definition

### Frontend Changes  
- **Modified** `frontend/db/schema.ts` - Removed capTableUploads table definition and companies relation
- All other cap_table_uploads related files (tRPC routes, pages, services, tests) were already removed in previous commits

## Feature Overview (Removed)
The cap_table_uploads feature allowed administrators to:
- Upload cap table documents (Excel/JSON files, max 4 files)
- Process documents using OpenAI to extract investor and share data
- Track upload status (submitted, processing, completed, etc.)
- Populate company cap table data automatically

## Database Migration
Since the cap_table_uploads table does not exist in the current database state, no migration is needed. The schema files have been updated to reflect the removal.

## Verification
- ✅ All references to cap_table_uploads, capTableUploads, CapTableUpload removed
- ✅ Company model and spec updated to remove association
- ✅ Database schemas updated on both backend and frontend
- ✅ Clean git history without build artifacts

3161086296,382,Fix mobile font size for contractor payments heading,"# Fix mobile font size for contractor payments heading

## Problem
The ""Contractor payments"" heading on the marketing homepage was using `text-[84px]` (84px) as the base font size for mobile screens, causing the text to be too large and potentially overflow on mobile devices.

## Solution
- Reduced the mobile base font size from `text-[84px]` to `text-6xl` (60px)
- Maintained the existing responsive scaling pattern with `sm:text-8xl` and `md:text-[12rem]`
- This ensures the heading fits properly within mobile screen boundaries while preserving visual hierarchy

## Changes
- Modified `frontend/app/(marketing)/page.tsx` line 57
- Changed font size classes from `text-[84px] leading-[0.9] font-medium tracking-tight sm:text-8xl md:text-[12rem]` to `text-6xl leading-[0.9] font-medium tracking-tight sm:text-8xl md:text-[12rem]`

## Testing
- Lint checks passed with no ESLint warnings or errors
- Local testing was attempted but blocked by environment setup issues (Vercel CLI configuration)
- The font size reduction from 84px to 60px follows standard Tailwind CSS sizing and should resolve mobile overflow issues

## Summary
This PR adds the `user.taxInformationConfirmedAt` condition to the existing `hasLegalDetails` check in the invoices functionality, as requested in the Slack channel #flexile.

## Changes Made
- **Modified `useCanSubmitInvoices` hook** in `frontend/app/invoices/index.tsx`:
  - Added `trpc.users.get.useQuery({ id: user.id })` to fetch user compliance data
  - Updated `hasLegalDetails` check to require both `user.address.street_address` AND `userData?.taxInformationConfirmedAt`

- **Updated users TRPC router** in `frontend/trpc/routes/users/index.ts`:
  - Added `taxInformationConfirmedAt: user.userComplianceInfos[0]?.taxInformationConfirmedAt` to the returned user data

## Technical Details
The change ensures that users must have both:
1. A valid street address (`user.address.street_address`)
2. Confirmed tax information (`user.taxInformationConfirmedAt`)

This follows the same pattern used in the existing `useAreTaxRequirementsMet` hook which checks `invoice.contractor.user.complianceInfo?.taxInformationConfirmedAt`.

## Testing
- ✅ Lint checks passed successfully (""No ESLint warnings or errors"")
- ⚠️ Local testing was blocked by Vercel CLI environment configuration issues
- The code changes follow existing patterns and TypeScript compilation is successful

3161731684,385,Remove signature email requirements when contract_signed_elsewhere is true,"# Remove signature email requirements when contract_signed_elsewhere is true

## Summary
This PR fixes the issue where signature-related emails (including ""Signature required"" and ""Review & sign"" notifications) were being sent to both contractors and admins even when a contractor's contract was signed elsewhere (`contract_signed_elsewhere` flag is true). Since these contracts are managed outside of Flexile, no signature requests should be sent.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added missing `contractSignedElsewhere` field to frontend schema
- Updated `companyContractors` table definition in `frontend/db/schema.ts` to include the missing boolean field that exists in the backend database

### 2. Fixed tax settings change emails to admins
- Modified `updateTaxSettings` TRPC route in `frontend/trpc/routes/users/index.ts`
- Added contractor lookup to check `contractSignedElsewhere` status before sending signature emails to admins
- When flag is true, the route returns early without creating documents or sending signature request emails

### 3. Fixed rate update emails to contractors  
- Updated contractor rate update logic in `frontend/trpc/routes/contractors/index.ts`
- Added conditional check to skip document creation and signature-related email content when `contractSignedElsewhere` is true
- Rate change notification emails are still sent, but without the ""Review & sign"" button and document creation

## Testing
- Code passes ESLint checks (`bin/lint`)
- Changes follow existing patterns in the codebase (contractor invitation emails already handle this flag correctly)
- Maintains backward compatibility for contractors who do need to sign contracts within Flexile

## Impact
- ✅ No more ""Signature required"" emails sent to admins for contractors with externally signed contracts
- ✅ No more ""Review & sign"" buttons in rate update emails for contractors with externally signed contracts  
- ✅ Existing functionality preserved for contractors who need to sign within Flexile
- ✅ Follows existing code patterns and maintains consistency

3161872621,387,Fix equity split percentage not updating when allocation is locked,"# Fix equity split percentage not updating when allocation is locked

## Problem
When submitting an invoice with a new equity split percentage (e.g., 17%), the database was not being updated with the new value. This caused the invoice edit page to continue showing the old locked equity split (e.g., 50%) instead of the newly selected percentage.

## Root Cause
The issue was in the tRPC equity allocation update route (`frontend/trpc/routes/equityAllocations.ts`). The `onConflictDoUpdate` operation had a condition `setWhere: eq(equityAllocations.locked, false)` that prevented updates when the equity allocation was already locked.

This meant that when users submitted invoices with new equity percentages:
1. The frontend would call the equity allocation update mutation
2. The update would silently fail due to the locked condition
3. The backend invoice service would read the old (unchanged) equity percentage from the database
4. The invoice would be saved with the old percentage instead of the new one

## Solution
Removed the `setWhere: eq(equityAllocations.locked, false)` condition from the equity allocation update operation. This allows equity percentage updates even when the allocation is locked, which matches the expected behavior described in PR #381 (""Allow equity split changes when allocation is locked"").

## Changes Made
- **Modified**: `frontend/trpc/routes/equityAllocations.ts`
  - Removed the `setWhere` condition that prevented updates to locked equity allocations
  - Now allows equity percentage updates regardless of locked status

## Testing Required
Since I encountered environment setup issues preventing local testing, this PR requires manual testing to verify:

1. **Create an invoice** with an initial equity split percentage (e.g., 50%)
2. **Submit the invoice** to lock the equity allocation
3. **Edit the same invoice** and change the equity split to a different percentage (e.g., 17%)
4. **Re-submit the invoice**
5. **Verify** that the invoice edit page now shows the updated percentage (17%) instead of the old one (50%)
6. **Verify** that the database contains the correct updated equity percentage

3154367340,375,Fix contractor invitation email copy for contracts signed elsewhere,"## Summary
Fixes the contractor invitation email to show different copy when the 'contract signed elsewhere' toggle is enabled.

## Problem
When a company administrator toggles on ""user has signed a contract elsewhere"" for a contractor, the invitation email still sends messaging about ""Review and sign your contract"" which is confusing since the contract is already signed elsewhere.

## Solution
Updated the contractor invitation email template to show conditional messaging based on the `contract_signed_elsewhere` field:

**When contracts are signed elsewhere (`contract_signed_elsewhere = true`):**
- Heading: ""...invited you to join Flexile to get set up for payment...""
- Button: ""Set up your payment info""

**When contracts need to be signed through Flexile (`contract_signed_elsewhere = false`):**
- Heading: ""...invited you to join Flexile to sign your contract... and get paid.""
- Button: ""Review and sign your contract""

## Changes
- Updated email heading in `backend/app/views/shared/_contractor_invitation.html.erb` to focus on payment setup instead of contract signing when `contract_signed_elsewhere` is true
- Changed button text from always showing 'Review and sign your contract' to conditionally show 'Set up your payment info' when contracts are signed elsewhere
- Maintained existing functionality for the normal contract signing flow

## Testing
- Verified conditional logic works for both contract scenarios
- Ran linter to ensure code quality

3154457494,376,Add BRL (Brazilian Real) currency support for Brazilian contractors,"# Add BRL (Brazilian Real) Currency Support

## Problem
Brazilian contractors were unable to select BRL (Brazilian Real) as their currency during bank account setup, despite Brazil being fully supported for Wise payouts and equity contracts in the backend. This forced Brazilian contractors to use USD instead of their local currency.

## Root Cause
BRL was completely missing from the `CURRENCIES` array in `/frontend/models/constants.ts`, and there was no BR->BRL mapping in the `currencyByCountryCode` Map.

## Solution
- ✅ Added BRL entry to the `CURRENCIES` array in alphabetical order
- ✅ Added BR->BRL mapping to the `currencyByCountryCode` Map
- ✅ Verified lint checks pass with no errors or warnings

## Impact
Brazilian contractors can now:
1. Select BRL as their preferred currency during bank account setup
2. Have BRL automatically suggested as the default currency based on their country (BR)
3. Set up Brazilian bank accounts through the existing Wise integration

## Backend Support Confirmed
- Brazil is included in `SUPPORTED_COUNTRY_CODES` for equity contracts
- Brazil has `""supportsWisePayout"": true` in countries.json
- Wise integration already handles Brazilian address requirements (state selection)

## Testing Notes
- Lint checks pass successfully
- No existing BRL references found that would conflict
- Changes are minimal and focused on frontend currency configuration only

3154752026,377,Automate dividend email sending,"# Automate Dividend Email Sending

## Summary
This PR automates the manual dividend email sending process by adding a `send_dividend_emails` method to the `DividendRound` model and updating the documentation to integrate email sending into the dividend creation workflow.

## Changes Made

### Backend Changes
- **Added `send_dividend_emails` method to `DividendRound` model** (`backend/app/models/dividend_round.rb`)
  - Iterates through all investors in the dividend round
  - Creates `InvestorDividendRound` records as needed
  - Calls existing `send_dividend_issued_email` method for each investor
  - Uses the exact same logic as the previous manual process

### Documentation Changes
- **Updated `docs/dividends.md`** to integrate email sending into dividend creation workflow:
  - Changed note at line 63 to mention automatic email sending
  - Added manual email sending instructions in the ""Manual Dividends"" section
  - Updated ""From Existing Cap Table"" workflow to reference the new method
  - **Removed the manual ""Send Dividend-Issued Emails"" section** from ""Processing Dividends""

## Benefits
- **Single command execution**: `dividend_round.send_dividend_emails` replaces the multi-line manual process
- **Integrated workflow**: Email sending is now part of the dividend creation process instead of a separate step
- **Reduced human error**: Eliminates the risk of forgetting to send dividend emails
- **Maintains existing functionality**: Uses the same underlying email logic with built-in guards

## Testing
- ✅ Code passes linting (`bin/lint`)
- ✅ Method follows existing codebase patterns for batch operations
- ✅ Leverages existing `InvestorDividendRound#send_dividend_issued_email` with built-in duplicate prevention

## Technical Details
The new method replicates the exact logic from the manual process documented in lines 222-229 of the original documentation:

```ruby
def send_dividend_emails
  company.company_investors.joins(:dividends)
    .where(dividends: { dividend_round_id: id })
    .group(:id)
    .each do |investor|
      investor_dividend_round = investor.investor_dividend_rounds.find_or_create_by!(dividend_round_id: id)
      investor_dividend_round.send_dividend_issued_email
    end
end
```

The existing `send_dividend_issued_email` method already includes guards to prevent duplicate emails, making this automation safe to call multiple times.

3154857294,378,Add CPF validation to bank account form,"# Add CPF validation to bank account form

## Summary
Implements Brazilian CPF (Cadastro de Pessoas Físicas) validation in the bank account form to ensure users cannot submit invalid CPF numbers.

## Changes Made
- **Added CPF validation function**: Implements the official Brazilian CPF checksum algorithm that validates the last two check digits
- **Integrated with existing validation system**: Added CPF-specific validation to the `validateField` function for fields with key ""cpf""
- **Error messaging**: Displays ""This CPF number looks invalid"" underneath invalid CPF inputs
- **Visual feedback**: Highlights invalid CPF input fields in red using existing error styling
- **Form submission prevention**: Invalid CPF numbers prevent form submission until corrected
- **Fixed TypeScript compatibility**: Resolved ES6 regex flag issues for better browser compatibility

## Implementation Details
The CPF validation follows the official Brazilian algorithm:
1. Removes all non-digit characters from input
2. Validates exactly 11 digits are present
3. Rejects known invalid patterns (all same digits)
4. Calculates first check digit using weights 10-2 on first 9 digits
5. Calculates second check digit using weights 11-2 on first 10 digits
6. Verifies both calculated check digits match the input

## Testing
⚠️ **Environment Issue**: Unable to test locally due to Redis connection error preventing `bin/dev` from starting. The implementation follows existing validation patterns in the codebase and passed ESLint validation.

**Test Cases to Verify**:
- Invalid CPF `091638586810` should show error message and red highlighting
- Valid CPF numbers should be accepted without errors
- Form submission should be blocked with invalid CPF
- Form submission should proceed with valid CPF

3271282745,661,Add Turbopack support for faster development builds,"# Add Turbopack to Development Workflow

## Summary

This PR integrates Turbopack into the flexile development workflow to improve build performance. The changes add the `--turbopack` flag to development commands in both `Procfile.dev` and `Procfile.test`, while maintaining the existing `--no-lint` flags in build scripts based on team feedback.

**Key Changes:**
- ✅ Added `--turbopack` to development servers in Procfiles for faster compilation (~564ms locally)
- ✅ Maintained `--no-lint` flags in build scripts (confirmed as intentional by team)
- ✅ Confirmed `--turbopack` is only used for `next dev`, not `next build` (unsupported)
- ⚠️ Turbopack shows compatibility warnings for `typedRoutes` but functionality is maintained per user requirements

## Review & Testing Checklist for Human

**Critical (4 items):**

- [ ] **Test full development workflow end-to-end** with `pnpm foreman start -f Procfile.dev` to ensure all features work correctly with Turbopack, especially anything relying on typed routes
- [ ] **Verify typed routes functionality** still works correctly despite Turbopack compatibility warnings - test route navigation, type safety, and any generated route utilities
- [ ] **Confirm --no-lint flag behavior** is actually desired - verify that autofix workflow handles linting as intended and that skipping lint in builds doesn't cause issues
- [ ] **Test both development and build processes** to ensure no regressions from the environment inconsistency (dev uses Turbopack, builds don't)

**Performance Impact:** Development server now compiles in ~564ms (tested locally) vs previous webpack compilation times.

### Notes

- **Turbopack Limitations**: Build support (`next build --turbopack`) is not yet stable in Next.js 15, so only development uses Turbopack
- **typedRoutes Compatibility**: Turbopack shows warnings about `experimental.typedRoutes` being unsupported, but user explicitly requested to maintain this configuration
- **Team Feedback Conflict**: Initial confusion about `--no-lint` flag validity was resolved by @MayaRainer confirming it's intentional to save CI time since autofix handles linting
- **CI Status**: All checks now passing after restoring `--no-lint` flags

## Summary

Removed the share classes table from the cap table page (`/equity/cap_table`) so that the page now displays only the investors table, as requested via Slack. The backend API continues to return `shareClasses` data, but the frontend no longer renders this data in a table format.

**Changes made:**
- Removed `shareClassColumnHelper` and `shareClassesColumns` definitions
- Removed `shareClassesData` processing logic that combined share classes with option pools
- Removed `shareClassesTable` creation and rendering
- Removed the second `DataTable` component and its conditional rendering logic
- Kept all investors table functionality completely intact

## Review & Testing Checklist for Human

- [ ] **Load the cap table page and verify it displays only the investors table without errors**
- [ ] **Test investors table functionality**: row selection, ""Contact selected"" button, email copying
- [ ] **Check browser console for JavaScript errors** when loading the page
- [ ] **Test with different data scenarios**: empty state (no investors), populated state with multiple investors
- [ ] **Verify page layout and styling** looks correct without the second table

3264140320,632,Replace bank account alert with placeholder for all users,"# Replace bank account alert with placeholder for all users

## Summary

This PR expands the bank account placeholder UI to show for both workers and investors when they have no bank accounts configured, instead of only showing it for investors. The change also updates the placeholder text to be more generic and appropriate for all user types.

**Key Changes:**
- Modified condition in `BankAccountsSection` to show placeholder for `user.roles.investor || user.roles.worker` instead of just `user.roles.investor`
- Updated placeholder text from ""Set up your bank account to receive payouts."" to ""Connect a bank account to debit contractor payments and our monthly fee.""
- Maintains existing behavior for sanctioned country users (they still see the alert)

This addresses the issue shown in the provided image where users without bank accounts should see helpful placeholder UI with setup instructions rather than alerts.

## Review & Testing Checklist for Human

- [ ] **Test with different user roles**: Verify that workers without bank accounts now see the placeholder (previously they may have seen nothing or an alert)
- [ ] **Verify text appropriateness**: Confirm that ""Connect a bank account to debit contractor payments and our monthly fee"" is accurate and appropriate for all user types who will see this message
- [ ] **Test sanctioned country behavior**: Ensure users from sanctioned countries still see the appropriate destructive alert instead of the placeholder
- [ ] **Visual verification**: Navigate to `/settings/payouts` as different user types to confirm the UI looks correct and matches the design intent
- [ ] **Test placeholder functionality**: Verify the ""Add bank account"" button still works correctly for all user types

**Recommended Test Plan:**
1. Create test accounts with worker and investor roles that have no bank accounts
2. Navigate to the payouts settings page and verify the placeholder appears with the correct text and button
3. Test the ""Add bank account"" flow works correctly
4. Test with a sanctioned country user to ensure they still see the alert

3264148034,633,Remove caption prop from DataTable component,"# Remove caption prop from DataTable component

## Summary
Removed the `caption` prop from the DataTable component interface and updated all existing usages to align with how the investors table works (without captions). This change affects the DataTable component itself and two pages that were using the caption feature.

**Key Changes:**
- Removed `caption?: string` from DataTable interface in `DataTable.tsx`
- Removed TableCaption rendering logic and import
- Updated cap table page to remove `caption=""Investors""` 
- Updated options page to remove caption and cleaned up unused imports (`pluralizeGrants` function and `pluralize` import)

## Review & Testing Checklist for Human
- [ ] **Visual verification**: Load cap table and options pages to confirm tables render correctly without captions
- [ ] **Comprehensive usage check**: Search codebase for any remaining `caption` prop usages with DataTable that might have been missed
- [ ] **Functional testing**: Verify table sorting, filtering, and row selection still work properly on affected pages
- [ ] **Requirement alignment**: Confirm this matches the intended ""like investors"" behavior

**Recommended Test Plan:**
1. Navigate to `/equity/cap_table` and verify the investors table looks correct without ""Investors"" caption
2. Navigate to `/equity/options` and verify the grants table looks correct without the grants count caption  
3. Test table interactions (sorting, filtering, row clicks) on both pages
4. Compare visual styling with other DataTable usages to ensure consistency

- **Breaking change**: This removes the caption prop from the DataTable interface entirely - comprehensive search found only 2 usages, but double-check recommended
- **Cleaned up imports**: Removed unused `pluralizeGrants` function and `pluralize` import from options page as they were only used for caption generation

3264234493,634,Rename 'Cap table' to 'Investors' and update URL routing,"# Rename 'Cap table' to 'Investors' and update URL routing

## Summary

This PR renames all frontend references from ""Cap table"" to ""Investors"" and updates the URL routing from `/equity/cap_table` to `/equity/investors`. The changes are limited to frontend UI text and file-system routing while keeping all backend code, database schema, and API references unchanged.

**Key Changes:**
- Renamed folder from `cap_table` to `investors` for Next.js file-system routing
- Updated navigation menu label from ""Cap table"" to ""Investors""
- Updated page breadcrumb from ""Cap table"" to ""Investors""
- Updated route reference from `/equity/cap_table` to `/equity/investors`
- Updated test comment to reference new route

## Review & Testing Checklist for Human

- [ ] **Navigate to `/equity/investors`** and verify the page loads correctly with all functionality intact
- [ ] **Check old route handling** - verify `/equity/cap_table` returns 404 or handles gracefully (this is a breaking URL change)
- [ ] **Verify UI text updates** - confirm navigation menu shows ""Investors"" and breadcrumb shows ""Investors"" instead of ""Cap table""
- [ ] **Run full test suite** to ensure no existing tests are broken by the route change
- [ ] **Test page functionality** - verify investor table, selection, and all interactive elements work correctly

**Recommended Test Plan:** Start the app locally, navigate through the equity section, verify the new ""Investors"" menu item works, test the page functionality, and confirm no broken links or references to the old route.

### Notes

- This is a **breaking change** for the URL structure - existing bookmarks or deep links to `/equity/cap_table` will no longer work
- All backend code, database schema fields (like `cap_table_enabled`, `cap_table_notes`), and tRPC router names remain unchanged per repository guidelines
- Next.js file-system routing automatically handles the URL mapping after the folder rename
- Auto-generated build files will update automatically when the app rebuilds

3264354400,635,Fix cap table ownership percentage calculations,"# Fix cap table ownership percentage calculations

## Summary

Fixed a bug where the cap table displayed 0% values for ownership percentages. The issue was caused by a stale closure in the `investorsColumns` useMemo hook - the hook was referencing `data.outstandingShares` and `data.fullyDilutedShares` in its callback but had an empty dependency array, preventing the columns from recalculating when data changed.

**Change**: Added `data` to the dependency array of the `investorsColumns` useMemo hook in `frontend/app/(dashboard)/equity/cap_table/page.tsx`.

## Review & Testing Checklist for Human

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: This fix was not tested locally due to development environment issues**

- [ ] **Load the cap table page and verify ownership percentages display correctly** (most critical - the core bug fix)
- [ ] **Test performance impact** - check if adding `data` dependency causes excessive re-renders during data loading/refetching
- [ ] **Test edge cases** - verify behavior when data is loading, empty, or in error states  
- [ ] **Code review** - confirm that using `data` as a useMemo dependency is architecturally sound vs other approaches

**Recommended test plan**: Navigate to the equity cap table page with real investor data and confirm that ownership percentages show actual calculated values instead of 0%.

### Notes

- This addresses the bug reported in the Slack thread where cap table showed 0% ownership values
- The fix is theoretically sound but **could not be tested locally** due to database connectivity issues in the dev environment
- Performance impact should be minimal since `data` changes infrequently, but this should be verified

2770724281,3349,Fix Polars GroupBy Issue #3348,"# Fix Polars GroupBy Issue #3348

This PR fixes an issue where group by transformations in Polars were not correctly referencing the original column names in the generated code.

## Changes
- Modified the code generation in `print_code.py` to use `pl.col()` for group by columns
- Added test case `test_polars_groupby_alias` to verify proper column name handling in group by transformations
- Ensures both group by and aggregation operations reference original column names correctly

## Testing
Added a new test that:
- Creates a test DataFrame with ""group"" and ""age"" columns
- Applies a group by transformation with max aggregation
- Verifies the transformed DataFrame structure and values
- Checks that the generated code correctly uses `pl.col()` for both group by and aggregation columns

3197139442,62497,docs: fix V1 telemetry configuration in operator guide,"# Fix V1 Telemetry Configuration Documentation

## Problem
The current telemetry documentation incorrectly suggests that users can disable telemetry in Helm Chart V1 by simply defining `TRACKING_STRATEGY=logging` in their values.yaml file. However, code analysis of the V1 chart reveals that `TRACKING_STRATEGY` is hardcoded to `""segment""` in the `env-configmap.yaml` template, making the documented approach ineffective.

## Root Cause
In Helm Chart V1's `templates/env-configmap.yaml` (line 146), `TRACKING_STRATEGY` is hardcoded as:
```yaml
TRACKING_STRATEGY: segment
```

All references to `TRACKING_STRATEGY` in the V1 `values.yaml` file are commented out, providing no native way to configure this setting.

## Solution
Updated the telemetry documentation to:

1. **Add separate tabs for V1 and V2 configurations** - Clearly distinguishes between chart versions
2. **Provide correct V1 syntax** - Shows how to use component-specific `env_vars` sections to override the hardcoded value:
   ```yaml
   server:
     env_vars:
       TRACKING_STRATEGY: logging
   worker:
     env_vars:
       TRACKING_STRATEGY: logging
   ```
3. **Add explanatory note** - Explains that V1 hardcodes the value and requires `env_vars` overrides
4. **Preserve V2 documentation** - Shows the simpler `global.tracking.strategy` approach for V2

## Verification
- Code analysis confirmed `TRACKING_STRATEGY` is hardcoded to `""segment""` in V1 chart templates
- V1 chart supports `env_vars` configuration for environment variable overrides
- V2 chart provides native `global.tracking.strategy` configuration

## Impact
- Fixes misleading documentation that would not work for V1 users
- Provides accurate configuration examples for both chart versions
- Helps users successfully disable telemetry in their V1 deployments

3105479979,343,Fix timezone handling in tender offer participation,"# Fix timezone handling in tender offer participation

## Problem
Users were unable to participate in tender offers (buybacks) due to timezone inconsistencies between frontend and backend date comparisons. The `isFuture` function on the frontend compared dates against local browser time, while the backend used server timezone, causing tender offers to appear closed on the frontend but open on the backend (or vice versa).

## Solution
- **Frontend**: Updated `isFuture` and `isPast` checks in tender offer page to use UTC with `utc()` wrapper
- **tRPC validation**: Modified date comparisons in bid creation/deletion to use UTC consistently
- **Backend**: Explicitly use UTC in `TenderOffer#open?` method with `Time.current.utc`

## Changes
- `frontend/app/equity/tender_offers/[id]/page.tsx`: Use UTC for tender offer open/closed status check
- `frontend/trpc/routes/tenderOffers/bids.ts`: Use UTC for date range validation in bid operations
- `backend/app/models/tender_offer.rb`: Explicitly use UTC in `open?` method

## Testing
- Lint checks passed successfully
- Changes ensure consistent timezone handling across the entire tender offer system
- Follows existing UTC pattern established in `formatServerDate` utility

3127552216,357,Migrate remaining Input type='date' usages to DatePicker component,"# Migrate remaining Input type=""date"" usages to DatePicker component

This PR completes the migration of the remaining `<Input type=""date""` usages to use the `DatePicker` component, following the established pattern from the tender offers implementation.

## Changes Made

### Tax Settings Page (`frontend/app/settings/tax/page.tsx`)
- Migrated birth_date field from `<Input type=""date""` to `<DatePicker>`
- Updated form schema to use `z.instanceof(CalendarDate).nullable()` instead of `z.string().nullable()`
- Added imports for `DatePicker` and `CalendarDate` from `@internationalized/date`

### People Page (`frontend/app/people/[id]/page.tsx`)
- Migrated end contract date from `<Input type=""date""` to `<DatePicker>`
- Updated state management from string to `CalendarDate` type
- Added date conversion to string when passing to backend API
- Removed unused imports (`formatISO`, `Label`, `useId`)

## Implementation Details

- Follows the established pattern from `frontend/app/equity/tender_offers/new/page.tsx`
- Uses `CalendarDate` from `@internationalized/date` for type safety
- Maintains nullable support for optional birth_date field
- Preserves existing form validation and error handling
- Compatible with existing `fillDatePicker` test helper

## Testing

- ✅ Lint checks pass with no warnings or errors
- ✅ No remaining `<Input type=""date""` instances found in codebase
- ✅ DatePicker components follow established patterns
- ✅ Form validation schemas updated correctly

The `fillDatePicker` test helper from `e2e/helpers/index.ts` should work seamlessly with the new DatePicker components.

3112058547,351,Remove dividends_allowed feature flag,"# Remove dividends_allowed feature flag

This PR removes the `dividends_allowed` feature flag from the Flexile codebase, making dividends functionality available to all companies by default instead of being gated behind a flag.

## Changes Made

### Backend Changes
- **User Presenter**: Removed conditional checks for `company.dividends_allowed?` on lines 93 and 200, now always includes ""dividends"" in feature flags
- **Pay Investor Dividends Service**: Removed feature validation check that would raise an exception if dividends weren't allowed
- **Dividend Round Policy**: Removed flag check, now only validates user permissions (administrator or lawyer)

### Frontend Changes  
- **tRPC Dividend Rounds Router**: Removed `dividendsAllowed` flag checks from both `list` and `get` endpoints
- **Database Schema**: Removed `dividendsAllowed` column definition from companies table schema

### Test Updates
- Updated all test files to remove `dividends_allowed: true` from company creation
- Removed test case that verified exception when dividends_allowed was false
- Updated system tests to remove flag setup calls

### Documentation & Data
- Updated seed template for Gumroad to remove dividends_allowed flag
- Updated dividends documentation to reflect that dividends are now enabled by default

## Impact
- Dividends functionality is now available to all companies without requiring a feature flag
- No breaking changes to existing dividends functionality
- Simplified codebase by removing unnecessary feature gating

## Testing
- ✅ Linting passes with no errors
- All dividend-related functionality remains intact
- Authorization still properly enforced (admin/lawyer access required)

## Notes
- Database migration files were intentionally left unchanged as they represent historical schema changes
- The `dividends_allowed` column still exists in the database but is no longer referenced in application code

# Add professional English communication and test screenshot requirements to PR guidelines

## Summary

Updated CONTRIBUTING.md files across three repositories (gumroad, helper, flexile) to add two new requirements for pull requests:

1. **Test Screenshots**: Contributors must include screenshots of their test suite passing locally
2. **Professional English**: Contributors must use professional English with no excessive capitalization, question marks, or informal language (zero tolerance policy for async communication clarity)

The flexile repository required creating a new CONTRIBUTING.md file from scratch since none existed previously. All changes maintain consistent wording and positioning across repositories.

## Review & Testing Checklist for Human

- [ ] **Review professional English requirement wording**: Verify the ""zero tolerance policy"" language is appropriate and not too harsh for the organization's culture
- [ ] **Check formatting consistency**: Ensure numbering sequences and formatting are correct across all three CONTRIBUTING.md files after inserting new requirements
- [ ] **Validate flexile CONTRIBUTING.md**: Since this file was created entirely from scratch, review it comprehensively to ensure it doesn't include inappropriate content and follows proper patterns for the repository
- [ ] **Verify requirement positioning**: Confirm the new requirements are positioned logically within the PR sections and don't conflict with existing workflows

### Notes

- The professional English requirement uses strong ""zero tolerance"" language - please review if this aligns with organizational communication standards
- All three repositories now have consistent PR requirements that encourage visual proof of testing and professional async communication
- The flexile repository previously had no CONTRIBUTING.md file, so the entire file structure was created following patterns from gumroad and helper repositories

3204784695,440,Fix: Prevent admin emails when contractSignedElsewhere is true,"
# Fix: Prevent admin emails when contractSignedElsewhere is true

## Summary

This PR fixes a bug where admin users were receiving ""Signature required"" emails when contractors updated their tax information, even when `contractSignedElsewhere` was set to true for that contractor. 

The issue was in the `updateTaxSettings` procedure in the users router. While there was already a check for `contractor?.contractSignedElsewhere`, it appears this check wasn't catching all cases. The fix adds a more defensive approach by also checking `ctx.companyContractor?.contractSignedElsewhere` as a fallback.

When `contractSignedElsewhere` is true, there should be no document processing or email notifications sent to admins since the contract is signed outside the platform and there's no document to sign.

## Review & Testing Checklist for Human

**Risk Level: 🟡 Medium** - Simple change but critical email functionality that requires thorough testing

- [ ] **Verify emails are NOT sent when contractSignedElsewhere is true** - Test with a contractor that has this flag set, update their tax settings, and confirm no admin emails are sent
- [ ] **Verify emails ARE still sent when contractSignedElsewhere is false** - Test with a normal contractor to ensure the existing email flow still works
- [ ] **Test edge cases** - Verify the contractor lookup works correctly and the fallback logic handles cases where `contractor` and `ctx.companyContractor` might differ
- [ ] **Review the contractor lookup logic** - Understand when `contractor` vs `ctx.companyContractor` might have different values and if this defensive approach is the right solution

**Recommended Test Plan:**
1. Set up a contractor with `contractSignedElsewhere: true` 
2. Have that contractor update their tax information
3. Verify no ""Signature required"" emails are sent to admins
4. Repeat with a normal contractor (`contractSignedElsewhere: false`) and verify emails are sent

### Notes

# Remove mailto: prefix from contractor invite email input

## Summary
Implements a quality of life improvement for the contractor invite form by automatically removing ""mailto:"" prefixes from email addresses when users copy-paste them into the email input field.

**Changes made:**
- Added `removeMailtoPrefix` utility function that strips ""mailto:"" prefix (case-insensitive) using regex `/^mailto:/iu`
- Modified email input field's `onChange` handler to preprocess input values before form validation
- Follows existing input preprocessing patterns used in the codebase (similar to `formatTaxId` and `formatPhoneNumber`)

## Review & Testing Checklist for Human
**⚠️ Important: I was unable to test this locally due to development server issues, so manual testing is critical**

- [ ] **Test mailto: prefix removal**: Copy-paste email addresses with ""mailto:"" prefixes (try `mailto:test@example.com`, `MAILTO:test@example.com`, `Mailto:test@example.com`) and verify the prefix is automatically stripped
- [ ] **Test normal email input**: Verify that regular email typing/pasting without mailto: prefix still works correctly
- [ ] **Test form validation**: Ensure email validation still works properly after preprocessing (test invalid emails, empty inputs, etc.)
- [ ] **Test end-to-end contractor invite flow**: Complete a full contractor invitation to ensure the preprocessing doesn't break form submission or backend processing
- [ ] **Test edge cases**: Try pasting emails with multiple mailto: prefixes, emails that contain ""mailto:"" in the middle, etc.

3144708564,371,Add bank account status visibility to user profiles,"# Add bank account status visibility to user profiles

This PR adds a bank account status indicator to individual user profiles, allowing administrators to quickly determine if a user has added their bank account for payment purposes.

## Changes Made

- **Modified users tRPC route** (`frontend/trpc/routes/users/index.ts`):
  - Added `wiseRecipients` data fetching to determine bank account status
  - Added `hasBankAccount` field to the returned user object
  - Handles both current user and other user lookup scenarios

- **Updated individual profile page** (`frontend/app/people/[id]/page.tsx`):
  - Added bank account status indicator in the Personal info section
  - Uses existing `Status` component for consistent UI
  - Shows ""Bank account added"" (success variant) or ""Bank account not added"" (primary variant)

## Implementation Details

- Bank account status is determined by checking if the user has any `wiseRecipients` entries
- Follows existing code patterns from the contractors list query
- Uses sentence case for status text as per design guidelines
- Placed in the Personal info section alongside other user details

## Testing

- Lint checks pass with no ESLint warnings or errors
- Implementation follows existing UI patterns and component usage
- Uses the same data structure pattern as contractors list for consistency

**Note**: Local testing was limited due to Redis connection issues in the development environment, but the implementation follows established patterns in the codebase.

3158433932,380,Fix Add expense button functionality,"# Fix Add expense button functionality

## Problem
The ""Add expense"" button was not working because the file input was nested inside a Button component wrapped with a Label, creating conflicting interactive elements that prevented the file dialog from opening when clicked.

## Solution
- **Moved file input outside Button component**: Extracted the hidden file input from the Label wrapper inside the Button component
- **Added onClick handler**: Button now triggers the file input click via `uploadExpenseRef.current?.click()`
- **Updated e2e test**: Modified test to use `getByRole(""button"", { name: ""Add expense"" })` instead of `getByLabel(""Add expense"")`
- **Added comprehensive test**: New test verifies that multiple expense rows can be added successfully

## Changes Made
1. **frontend/app/invoices/Edit.tsx**: 
   - Moved file input outside Button/Label structure (lines 459-472)
   - Maintained existing styling and functionality
   - Used React fragment to group Button and input elements

2. **e2e/tests/company/invoices/create.spec.ts**:
   - Updated existing test to use proper button selector
   - Added new test ""allows adding multiple expense rows"" to verify the fix works
   - Test adds two expense files and verifies total calculation

## Testing
⚠️ **Note**: Could not test locally due to environment setup issues (missing Ruby gems and Vercel configuration). The fix follows the same pattern used elsewhere in the codebase (line 547-550) where the button correctly triggers the file input.

# Make withheld_tax_cents nullable in Zod schema

## Summary

Updated the Zod schema validation for `withheld_tax_cents` to allow nullable values by changing `z.number()` to `z.number().nullable()` at line 62 in the dividends page. Also updated the display logic to handle null values by defaulting to 0 when rendering the tax amount.

**Files changed:**
- `frontend/app/equity/dividends/page.tsx` - Updated Zod schema and display logic

## Review & Testing Checklist for Human

- [ ] **Verify backend API alignment** - Confirm that the backend API actually returns `null` for `withheld_tax_cents` in some cases (this change was made based on a specific request but should be validated against actual API responses)
- [ ] **Test dividend signing flow end-to-end** - Go through the complete dividend signing process to ensure the ""Taxes withheld"" display works correctly when the value is null
- [ ] **Validate business logic** - Confirm that displaying ""$0.00"" when `withheld_tax_cents` is null is the correct business behavior (rather than hiding the field or showing ""N/A"")
- [ ] **Check for other usage locations** - Search codebase for other places that might use `withheld_tax_cents` and verify they can handle nullable values

**Recommended test plan:** Create or find a dividend with null `withheld_tax_cents`, then test the signing flow to ensure the UI displays correctly and the process completes successfully.

# docs(source-oracle): Improve Oracle DB connector documentation

## Summary

This PR improves the Oracle DB connector documentation by fixing technical inaccuracies, adding missing configuration guidance, and enhancing clarity for data engineers. The changes are based on thorough source code analysis of the Oracle connector implementation and cross-referencing with Oracle JDBC documentation.

**Key Changes:**
- **Fixed features table**: Updated ""Coming soon"" items to accurate implementation status (TLS support is available, LogMiner/Flashback are not implemented)
- **Added connection type guidance**: Explained when to use Service Name vs SID with technical context
- **Enhanced encryption section**: Added detailed algorithm descriptions (AES256, RC4_56, 3DES168) with security recommendations
- **Added JDBC configuration section**: Documented optional URL parameters with practical examples
- **Improved technical accuracy**: Updated Oracle version compatibility info, added LONG/LONG RAW column handling details, fixed terminology consistency

## Review & Testing Checklist for Human

- [ ] **Verify features table accuracy**: Test that TLS encryption actually works and confirm LogMiner/Flashback are truly not available (most critical)
- [ ] **Validate connection type guidance**: Test both SID and Service Name connections to ensure the explanations are accurate
- [ ] **Check encryption algorithm details**: Verify the encryption algorithms and security recommendations are technically correct
- [ ] **Test JDBC parameter examples**: Confirm the provided JDBC URL parameter examples work correctly
- [ ] **Documentation rendering**: Verify the documentation builds and renders properly (build failed locally due to pre-existing Mermaid issues)

**Recommended test plan**: Set up Oracle connector with different connection types (SID vs Service Name) and encryption options (Unencrypted, NNE with different algorithms, TLS) to verify the documented behaviors match actual implementation.

# docs(source-bigquery): Add comprehensive incremental sync documentation

## Summary
This PR addresses user complaints about unclear incremental sync behavior by adding detailed documentation to the BigQuery source connector. Previously, the documentation only briefly mentioned incremental sync support without explaining implementation details, cursor field requirements, or optimization strategies.

**Key improvements:**
- Comprehensive explanation of incremental sync mechanics and cursor field requirements
- BigQuery-specific performance considerations including partitioning and clustering optimization
- Evidence-based cursor field type recommendations with technical justifications
- Best practices for query performance and cost optimization
- State management and resumability details

**GitHub comment responses:** Addressed detailed technical questions from Ian Alton about methodology, terminology precision, and educational purpose of SQL examples.

## Review & Testing Checklist for Human
- [ ] **Verify technical accuracy** of BigQuery partitioning/clustering performance claims against official Google Cloud documentation
- [ ] **Confirm implementation alignment** by reviewing `BigQuerySource.java` to ensure documented behavior matches actual connector implementation
- [ ] **Validate cursor field recommendations** - test that TIMESTAMP/DATETIME/DATE/INT64/STRING performance ranking is accurate for typical BigQuery workloads
- [ ] **Check BigQuery-specific terminology** - ensure ""clustering"" and ""partitioning"" language accurately reflects BigQuery's optimization mechanisms vs traditional indexing
- [ ] **Test documentation rendering** in Vercel preview to ensure proper formatting and link functionality

3151020831,61644,docs: Update Postgres connector docs to reflect CDC replica support in v3.6.21+,"# Update Postgres connector docs to reflect CDC replica support in v3.6.21+

## Summary

This PR updates the PostgreSQL connector documentation to accurately reflect that CDC replication from read replicas is now supported as of version 3.6.21. The documentation previously contained outdated statements claiming CDC requires primary/master databases only.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated main PostgreSQL documentation (`docs/integrations/sources/postgres.md`)
- **Line 103**: Changed from stating CDC ""must connect to primary/master databases"" to allowing both primary and replica connections
- Added version requirement (3.6.21+) and reference to PostgreSQL official documentation for replica configuration

### 2. Updated PostgreSQL troubleshooting documentation (`docs/integrations/sources/postgres/postgres-troubleshooting.md`)  
- **Line 39**: Updated statement to reflect that CDC can now run from read-replicas starting from version 3.6.21
- Maintained consistency with existing troubleshooting guidance for replica scenarios

## Technical Background

The replica CDC support was added in:
- **Version 3.6.21** (October 2024): [PR #46322](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/pull/46322) - ""Support CDC against a read-replica (continuation)""
- **Version 3.6.20** (September 2024): [PR #45397](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/pull/45397) - ""fix getLsn() utils function for read replicas""

The implementation uses `pg_is_in_recovery()` to detect replica status and adjusts behavior accordingly:
- **Transaction ID**: Uses `txid_snapshot_xmin(txid_current_snapshot())` on replicas vs `txid_current()` on primary
- **LSN**: Uses `pg_last_wal_receive_lsn()` on replicas vs `pg_current_wal_lsn()` on primary

## Consistency Note

The `cloud-sql-postgres.md` file already contained the correct information about replica support with version 3.6.21 requirements. These changes bring the main documentation in line with that existing accurate information.

3260740157,626,Add Clerk test user setup documentation for Playwright tests,"# Add Clerk test user setup documentation for Playwright tests

## Summary

Added comprehensive documentation to the README explaining how to create the 4 specific test users required by the Playwright tests in `e2e/helpers/auth.ts`. The tests were failing locally because the hardcoded user IDs and emails in `clerkTestUsers` don't exist in Clerk dashboard by default.

**Key changes:**
- Expanded the existing Clerk configuration section with a new ""Test User Setup for Playwright Tests"" subsection
- Documented the exact email addresses needed: `hi1+clerk_test@example.com` through `hi4+clerk_test@example.com`
- Explained that user IDs must be updated in the auth helper after creation since Clerk generates unique IDs
- Clarified why the Playwright tests fail without these users

## Review & Testing Checklist for Human

- [ ] **Verify Clerk dashboard UI matches documented process** - Test creating one user in your Clerk dashboard and confirm the steps align with the instructions
- [ ] **Validate the hardcoded user ID approach** - Check if this approach is correct vs using Clerk's standard testing environment variables (the codebase differs from Clerk's documented testing patterns)
- [ ] **Test the email authentication flow** - Confirm that the `hi1+clerk_test@example.com` email format works with Clerk's `email_code` strategy used in the tests
- [ ] **Review approach alignment** - The instructions tell users to update auth.ts with new user IDs, but consider if there's a better way to handle test user management

### Notes

- **Testing limitation**: Could not verify the documentation by running the actual Playwright tests due to environment setup issues (Ruby bundler errors)
- **Approach difference**: The flexile codebase uses hardcoded user IDs with email-based authentication, which differs from Clerk's standard testing documentation that uses environment variables for username/password authentication
- **Manual process**: The documentation assumes manual user creation in Clerk dashboard rather than programmatic creation, which may not be the most maintainable approach

2839377784,53238,feat: add ability to opt out of version increment checks,"# Description
Add ability to opt out of version increment checks via metadata flag.

## Changes
1. Added new field `requireVersionIncrementsInPullRequests` to AirbyteInternal metadata (defaults to true)
2. Modified version check implementation to respect this flag
3. Updated pipelines package version to 5.1.0

## Important Notes
- Only the pipelines package needed modification
- The connectors-qa package does not perform version increment checks - it only performs version consistency checks between files
- The version consistency checks in connectors-qa should remain mandatory to prevent:
  - Version numbers mismatching between files
  - Invalid semver versions
  - Package versions getting out of sync with Docker image tags

# chore(source-tidb): Convert to new gradle build flow (do not merge)

## Summary

This PR converts the `source-tidb` connector from the old `airbyte-java-connector` gradle plugin to the new `airbyte-bulk-connector` gradle build flow. This is part of a larger migration effort across 17 Java-based source connectors, following the pattern established in PR #60214.

**Key Changes:**
- **build.gradle**: Replaced `airbyte-java-connector` plugin with `airbyte-bulk-connector` plugin
- **build.gradle**: Updated configuration block to use `airbyteBulkConnector` instead of `airbyteJavaConnector`
- **build.gradle**: Removed `airbyteJavaConnector.addCdkDependencies()` call
- **metadata.yaml**: Updated `baseImage` from `2.0.0` to `2.0.1` with new SHA256 hash
- **metadata.yaml**: Added `connectorIPCOptions` block with dataChannel configuration

This is a mechanical conversion that maintains all existing functionality while adopting the new build system. The changes are minimal and focused solely on the build configuration.

## Review & Testing Checklist for Human

- [ ] **Verify connector builds successfully** - Run `./gradlew :airbyte-integrations:connectors:source-tidb:build` to ensure the new gradle configuration works
- [ ] **Test connector functionality** - Verify that the connector can still connect to TiDB and extract data properly
- [ ] **Check docker image compatibility** - Ensure the new baseImage version (`2.0.1`) is compatible with the connector's runtime requirements

### Notes

- This is part of a systematic migration across 17 connectors - this specific PR is for source-tidb (PR #62927)
- The conversion follows the exact pattern established in PR #60214 for source-postgres and source-mysql
- All existing dependencies and application configuration remain unchanged
- The new configuration uses: `core = 'extract'`, `toolkits = ['extract-jdbc']`, `cdk = 'local'`

This PR removes the option to switch between worker and admin roles from the sidebar navigation. Users who are both admin and worker will always see the admin view as requested in the Slack message.

## Changes
- Removed the SwitchRoleNavLink component from being rendered in the NavLinks component
- Completely deleted the SwitchRoleNavLink function
- Removed role display from the CompanyName component
- Updated useSwitchCompanyOrRole function to remove role switching parameters
- Removed the CompanyAccessRole type definition
- Removed unused imports (capitalize, ArrowPathIcon)

## Testing
- Attempted to run the app locally but encountered Vercel configuration issues
- Ran linting which passed after removing all role switching code
- Vercel deployment check is now passing

## Notes
- In the future, if we need to add what the worker sees to what admin+workers see, a more extensive change would be needed to combine both views.

2767652233,3335,fix: only parse valid ISO date strings in DATE_MIDDLEWARE,"Fixes #3330

Added strict ISO date string validation in DATE_MIDDLEWARE to prevent incorrect parsing of version-like strings (e.g., ""1.1.1"") as dates. This ensures we maintain consistency with Altair's behavior of treating non-ISO strings as nominal type.

Changes:
- Added regex validation for ISO date format

# Complete abctl command reference documentation

## Summary

This PR completes the abctl command reference documentation that was started in the abctl-guide branch. The reference section previously only had the `credentials` subcommand fully documented under the `local` command, with placeholder content for all other commands.

I've added comprehensive documentation for all remaining commands and subcommands, following the established expandable details panel pattern:

**Completed sections:**
- `local` command subcommands: `deployments`, `install`, `status`, `uninstall` 
- `images` command with nested `manifest` subcommand
- `version` command

Each section now includes proper descriptions, flag tables with examples, and maintains the nested expandable structure for subcommands.

## Review & Testing Checklist for Human

- [ ] **Verify command accuracy** - Compare the documented commands and flags against the actual abctl tool output (`abctl --help`, `abctl local --help`, etc.) to ensure all information is correct
- [ ] **Test expandable panels** - Check that all details/summary HTML tags render correctly as expandable panels in the documentation site
- [ ] **Verify completeness** - Cross-reference with the [abctl README](https://github.com/airbytehq/abctl) to ensure no commands or flags were missed
- [ ] **Check formatting consistency** - Ensure the new sections match the established pattern from the existing `credentials` section

**Recommended test plan:** Build the documentation locally (`cd docusaurus && pnpm start`) and navigate to the abctl reference section to verify all expandable panels work and content renders correctly.

### Notes

- All content was sourced from the official [abctl README](https://github.com/airbytehq/abctl) to ensure accuracy
- The documentation follows the exact expandable details panel pattern established by the existing `credentials` section
- The install command has the most comprehensive flag table (15+ flags) due to its extensive customization options
- Some build errors occurred during testing, but they appear unrelated to these documentation changes (React context errors in different parts of the site)

3199830965,432,Add option grant ID and stock certificate ID columns to exercises table,"
# Add option grant and stock certificate ID columns to exercises table

## Summary
Added two new columns to the exercises table in the People screen to display option grant IDs (GUM-xx format) and stock certificate IDs (C2-xx format). This enables admins to reconcile cash received to specific grants and stock certificates from the exercises view.

**Key Changes:**
- Updated tRPC router to include `exerciseRequests` with nested `equityGrant` and `shareHolding` relationships
- Added two new columns to the exercises table component with comma-separated display logic
- Created comprehensive e2e tests with custom factory for creating shareHolding records
- Implemented ""—"" placeholder display when shareHoldings don't exist

## Review & Testing Checklist for Human
- [ ] **Manual UI Testing**: Navigate to People → [user] → Exercises tab and verify both new columns display correctly with real data
- [ ] **Data Accuracy**: Verify the displayed IDs match expected GUM-xx and C2-xx formats by cross-referencing with known records
- [ ] **Performance Impact**: Check if the new nested database query causes any performance issues on pages with many exercise records
- [ ] **Edge Cases**: Test scenarios with missing shareHoldings, multiple exercise requests, and very long ID lists
- [ ] **Format Consistency**: Ensure the comma-separated display logic handles all edge cases properly

**Recommended Test Plan:**
1. Find a user with existing exercise records and verify the new columns show correct data
2. Test with a user who has exercises but no shareHoldings (should show ""—"")
3. Check performance with users who have many exercise records
4. Verify the displayed IDs can be used to reconcile cash as intended

### Notes
- The implementation uses the `name` field from `equityGrant` and `shareHolding` tables - verify this contains the expected GUM-xx and C2-xx format IDs
- E2e tests create real database records including shareClass dependencies - this factory pattern should be validated against production data patterns
- Performance impact of nested relationships in tRPC query should be monitored

3067709444,301,Add badge counter for documents requiring signatures,"# Add badge counter for documents requiring signatures

Similar to the badge for invoices, this PR adds a badge to the Documents navigation item to show the count of documents requiring signatures. This makes it easier for users to see at a glance how many documents need their attention.

## Implementation
- Created a new `DocumentsNavLink` component similar to the existing `InvoicesNavLink` component
- Used the `trpc.documents.list.useQuery` with `signable: true` parameter to get only documents that need signatures
- Updated the Documents navigation in the NavLinks component to use the new component

## Testing
- The implementation follows the same pattern as the existing Invoices badge counter
- The badge automatically handles displaying ""10+"" when the count exceeds 10
- The query uses a 30-second refetch interval to ensure the badge stays up-to-date

3230076518,63290,docs(connector-builder): Update overview page with schema-driven architecture details,"
# Update Connector Builder overview page with user-focused content

## Summary

Updated the Connector Builder overview documentation to improve accuracy and provide better context for end-users. The changes focus on explaining the UI as an intuitive interface equivalent to the low-code YAML format, with seamless switching between visual and code-based editing.

**Key changes:**
- **Simplified technical explanation**: Removed overly technical details about internal schema-driven form generation in favor of user-focused capabilities
- **Enhanced UI/YAML equivalence**: Emphasized that the UI provides the same capabilities as direct YAML editing with seamless switching
- **Fixed grammar issue**: Added missing article before ""Airbyte catalog""
- **Added ""How it works"" section**: New section explaining the Builder's capabilities from a user perspective
- **Updated process descriptions**: Modified step descriptions to be more user-focused

The content was initially more technical but was revised based on maintainer feedback to be more appropriate for the end-user audience. This PR now targets the feature branch `13167-docs-connector-builder-new-ui-schemaform-rollout` instead of master.

## Review & Testing Checklist for Human

- [ ] **Verify content appropriateness**: Ensure the simplified technical explanation strikes the right balance - accessible to end-users without being misleading about capabilities
- [ ] **Test documentation flow**: Navigate from this overview page to the tutorial and concept pages to ensure consistent tone, structure, and logical progression
- [ ] **Verify technical accuracy**: Confirm that the simplified explanation of UI/YAML equivalence and seamless switching is technically correct and doesn't oversimplify important details
- [ ] **Check preview rendering**: Review the page in the Vercel preview environment to ensure proper formatting and link functionality

**Recommended test plan**: Review the updated page in the preview environment, then navigate through the tutorial and related concept pages to verify the content flows naturally and maintains appropriate technical depth for the target audience.

# Update AI Assistant documentation with comprehensive feature details

## Summary

Updated the AI Assistant documentation (`docs/platform/connector-development/connector-builder-ui/ai-assist.md`) to provide more comprehensive and technically accurate information about the feature capabilities. The changes include:

- **Grammar fixes**: Corrected ""Less Time Spend"" to ""Less Time Spent"" and improved sentence structure
- **Expanded feature details**: Added technical specifics about supported configuration types (authentication methods, pagination schemes, incremental sync)
- **New capabilities documentation**: Added information about session management, error handling, and stream discovery
- **Enhanced workflow descriptions**: Expanded explanations of how the Assistant works with different documentation formats
- **User guidance**: Added a new ""Getting Started"" section with step-by-step instructions
- **Address reviewer feedback**: Removed paragraph about partial documentation and horizontal lines per Ian's comments

## Review & Testing Checklist for Human

- [ ] **Verify technical accuracy of new feature claims** - Test that the AI Assistant actually supports the described capabilities like session management, error handling, and incremental sync configuration
- [ ] **Test documentation build** - Ensure the updated markdown renders correctly in Docusaurus and all existing asset links still work
- [ ] **Validate user experience** - Check that the expanded content genuinely helps users understand and use the AI Assistant feature rather than creating confusion
- [ ] **Review consistency** - Ensure the tone, style, and technical level match other Connector Builder documentation

**Recommended test plan**: Try using the AI Assistant feature with the documented workflow to verify that the described capabilities actually work as documented.

# Add Selective Authenticator and Shared Authenticator documentation

## Summary

This PR adds comprehensive documentation for two authentication methods that were missing from the Connector Builder UI authentication documentation:

1. **Selective Authenticator** - Allows dynamic selection between different authentication methods based on configuration property values
2. **Shared Authenticator** - UI feature that enables sharing authenticator configurations across multiple connector components

These additions address specific feedback from Ian Alton requesting documentation for authentication methods visible in the UI but not covered in the docs.

**Key Changes:**
- Added detailed sections for both authentication methods with configuration options, examples, and use cases
- Updated the authentication methods list and table of contents to include the new methods
- Provided practical examples showing how to configure and use each authentication method
- Explained the UI interactions for the Shared Authenticator feature

## Review & Testing Checklist for Human

- [ ] **Test Selective Authenticator in UI** - Verify the configuration options and behavior match the documentation by creating a test connector
- [ ] **Test Shared Authenticator feature** - Confirm the link toggle, conflict resolution dialog, and sharing behavior work as described
- [ ] **Check documentation accuracy** - Ensure all technical details align with the actual implementation in the codebase
- [ ] **Verify internal links** - Test that the new table of contents links work correctly
- [ ] **Review examples** - Confirm the provided examples are practical and would work in real scenarios

**Recommended Test Plan:**
1. Open the Connector Builder UI
2. Try configuring a Selective Authenticator with multiple authentication options
3. Test the Shared Authenticator toggle functionality across different components
4. Verify the documentation builds correctly and all links work

### Notes

- This work was requested by Ian Alton (@ian-at-airbyte) who identified these authentication methods in the UI but found them missing from the documentation
- The documentation was created based on code analysis of the Python CDK implementation and UI components
- **Important**: The technical accuracy should be verified by testing these features in the actual Connector Builder UI since the documentation was created from code inspection rather than hands-on testing

# docs(connector-builder): Update record processing documentation with missing features and technical accuracy improvements

## Summary

Updated the Airbyte Connector Builder UI record processing documentation to include missing features and improve technical accuracy based on the current `declarative_component_schema.yaml` implementation. The changes add comprehensive documentation for previously undocumented features and enhance existing sections with more complete information.

**Key Changes:**
- Added documentation for `transform_before_filtering` property in RecordSelector
- Enhanced Record Filter section with complete interpolation context variables (config, next_page_token, stream_interval, stream_partition, stream_slice)
- Expanded Cast Record Fields to Schema Types with normalization options (Default vs None) and usage guidance
- Added practical examples for filter expressions using different context variables
- Fixed grammar issue (duplicate 'certain' in Record Filter section)
- Added note about schema-driven UI form generation for user context

## Review & Testing Checklist for Human

**Risk Level: 🟡 Medium** - Documentation changes based on schema analysis but not UI-tested

- [ ] **Verify interpolation context variables are accurate** - Test that all documented variables (config, next_page_token, stream_interval, stream_partition, stream_slice) are actually available in record filter expressions in the UI
- [ ] **Test transform_before_filtering behavior** - Confirm that this property works as documented (transformations before/after filtering) and that the default value is correct
- [ ] **Validate schema normalization options** - Check that the UI actually shows ""Default"" vs ""None"" options for schema normalization and that the behavior matches the description
- [ ] **Test filter expression examples** - Verify that the new examples work correctly in the Connector Builder UI (e.g., `record.status in ['active', 'expired']`, `record['created_at'] >= stream_interval['start_time']`)
- [ ] **Review end-user clarity** - Ensure the new technical details are accessible to users with basic technical competence

**Recommended Test Plan:**
1. Open Connector Builder UI and navigate to record processing section
2. Create a test connector and verify all documented features are present and work as described
3. Test filter expressions with different context variables to ensure they're available
4. Toggle schema normalization options to confirm behavior matches documentation

# Make / hour suffix conditional based on rate type

## Summary

This PR modifies the invoice detail page to conditionally display the ""/ hour"" suffix in the Cash rate column. The suffix now only appears for hourly line items (`lineItem.hourly = true`) and is hidden for project-based line items. This change improves clarity for invoices that contain mixed rate types (both hourly and project-based items in the same invoice).

**Files changed:**
- `frontend/app/invoices/[id]/page.tsx` - Updated conditional logic in rate display

## Review & Testing Checklist for Human

- [ ] **Test with mixed invoice types**: Create or view an invoice that contains both hourly and project-based line items to verify the conditional display works correctly
- [ ] **Verify visual formatting**: Check that rates without the ""/ hour"" suffix still look properly formatted and aligned in the table
- [ ] **Test edge cases**: Verify the change works with different rate values, zero rates, and null/undefined scenarios

**Recommended test plan**: Navigate to `/invoices/[id]` for invoices with mixed rate types and confirm that hourly items show ""/ hour"" while project-based items do not.

3015520806,178,Add Resend audience integration,"# Add Resend SDK Integration for Administrator Newsletter Subscription

This PR adds functionality to subscribe company administrators to our newsletter using the Resend SDK when they're created during onboarding.

## Changes

- Added a new private method `subscribe_administrator_to_newsletter` to the OnboardingController that:
  - Uses `Resend::Contacts.create` to subscribe the administrator
  - Includes error handling with both Rails logging and Bugsnag notification
- Added a call to this method in the `update` action, right after creating the company administrator
- Added comprehensive tests for the Resend integration
- Added the required `RESEND_AUDIENCE_ID` environment variable to the `.env` file

## Testing

The implementation includes tests that verify:
- That `Resend::Contacts.create` is called with the correct parameters
- That Bugsnag is notified when the Resend API call fails
- That the controller action still completes successfully despite API errors

Note: Local tests couldn't be run due to a Rails helper configuration issue, but the tests are designed to be run by CI.

## What

As a developer advocate working for Box.com we would like to contribute with a new source connector that will enable Airbyte users to extract data from documents stored in Box.

## How
Using the Box API endpoints:

- List folder Items
- Extract the text representation of a document
- Get a Box AI answer to a question or questions about a document
- Extract structured data in free format from an unstructured document
- Extract structured data using a formal structure from an unstructured document

## Review guide
A source with minimum parameters to access the Box API, and interact with the AI endpoints
Implements e streams, one for each feature.
On the Box side all streams look for files in a folder and can do so recursively.

## User Impact
NA - New source

## Can this PR be safely reverted and rolled back?
- [x] YES 💚

# Add professional English communication requirement to PR guidelines

## Summary
This PR adds a new requirement to the Pull Request guidelines in CONTRIBUTING.md, mandating the use of professional English in all communication. The change includes:

- Added step requiring ""professional English in all communication with no excessive capitalization, question marks, or informal language""
- Specified ""zero tolerance policy as it makes async communication difficult""
- Renumbered subsequent PR steps to maintain proper ordering

This change implements a communication standard requested to improve async collaboration quality across the development team.

## Review & Testing Checklist for Human
- [ ] **Verify policy wording aligns with company communication standards** - The ""zero tolerance"" language is quite strong and should match organizational expectations
- [ ] **Check enforceability and clarity** - Ensure the policy provides clear guidance on what constitutes violations (excessive capitalization, question marks, informal language)
- [ ] **Consider contributor impact** - Assess whether this policy might discourage new contributors or create barriers to participation
- [ ] **Validate consistency** - Confirm this same requirement has been added consistently across all three repositories (gumroad, helper, flexile)

3095452673,339,Add checkbox for contractors with contracts signed elsewhere,"# Add checkbox for contractors with contracts signed elsewhere

This PR adds a checkbox labeled ""Already signed contract elsewhere"" to the contractor invitation form. When checked, this negates the need for contractors to sign the Flexile consulting agreement in order to submit invoices and receive payments.

## Changes

- Added `contract_signed_elsewhere` boolean field to company_contractors table via Rails migration
- Updated contractor invitation form with checkbox in the dialog modal
- Modified backend logic to skip contract creation when checkbox is checked
- Updated tRPC schema and mutation to handle the new field
- Conditionally show/hide the TemplateSelector based on checkbox state

## Testing

The changes have been tested locally to ensure:
- The checkbox appears correctly in the contractor invitation form
- When checked, no contract is created for the contractor
- When unchecked, the normal contract flow is maintained

## Future Considerations

This implementation lays the groundwork for future features mentioned in the requirements:
- Making contracts optional when inviting
- Linking to signed documents
- Uploading signed PDFs
- Pasting rich text for signatures

3126249131,61441,fix(docker-images): align manifest-only Dockerfile with airbyte-ci build process,"# Fix manifest-only Dockerfile to align with airbyte-ci build process

## Summary
This PR fixes the manifest-only Dockerfile in the `docker-images` directory to align with the existing airbyte-ci build process for manifest-only connectors.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated base image reference
- **Before**: Hardcoded `airbyte/source-manifest-only:latest`
- **After**: Dynamic `docker.io/airbyte/source-declarative-manifest:latest` via ARG
- **Rationale**: Aligns with airbyte-ci enforcement that manifest-only connectors must use `docker.io/airbyte/source-declarative-manifest` as base image

### 2. Added proper file mounting logic
- **Before**: Simple `COPY . ./` without specific manifest handling
- **After**: Conditional copying of `manifest.yaml` and `components.py` to `source_declarative_manifest/` directory
- **Rationale**: Matches airbyte-ci build process that mounts these files to specific locations expected by the base image

### 3. Removed hardcoded entrypoint
- **Before**: Hardcoded `ENV AIRBYTE_ENTRYPOINT=""python ./main.py""` and `ENTRYPOINT [""python"", ""./main.py""]`
- **After**: Inherits entrypoint from base image
- **Rationale**: Allows base image to provide correct entrypoint configuration

### 4. Added connector version ARG
- Added `ARG CONNECTOR_VERSION` for consistency with other Dockerfile patterns

## Testing
- ✅ Successfully built with `source-reply-io` manifest-only connector
- ✅ Verified built image runs `spec` command correctly
- ✅ Confirmed file mounting works as expected

## Technical Details
The changes align the Dockerfile with the build process implemented in:
- `airbyte-ci/connectors/pipelines/pipelines/airbyte_ci/connectors/build_image/steps/manifest_only_connectors.py`
- Quality checks in `airbyte-ci/connectors/connectors_qa/src/connectors_qa/checks/packaging.py`

3126336730,61443,feat(ci): Add CDK CLI tests to Docker connector base image workflow,"# Add CDK CLI Tests to Docker Connector Base Image Workflow

This PR enhances the Docker connector base image tests workflow to include comprehensive CDK CLI testing operations after the existing `spec` tests.

## Changes Made

### Enhanced Test Coverage
- **Java connectors**: `source-postgres`, `destination-postgres`, `destination-snowflake`
- **Python connectors**: `source-google-drive`, `source-s3`, `source-salesforce`, `source-shopify`, `destination-motherduck`
- **Manifest-only connectors**: `source-pokeapi`

### New Test Operations Added
1. **Setup uv**: Uses `astral-sh/setup-uv@v4` GitHub Action
2. **Install CDK CLI**: Installs from temporary branch `aj/tests/add-docker-based-standard-tests`
3. **Fetch connector secrets**: Runs `airbyte-cdk secrets fetch {connector-name}`
4. **Run connector tests**: Runs `airbyte-cdk connector test {connector-name}`

### Temporary Adjustments
- CDK CLI installation uses the feature branch `aj/tests/add-docker-based-standard-tests` instead of direct installation
- Includes commented fallback syntax for easy toggle when ready: `uv tool install 'airbyte-cdk[dev]'`
- Added TODO note for future `--docker-only` flag to only run image-based tests

## Testing Strategy
The new test steps are applied consistently across all three connector types (Java, Python, manifest-only) to ensure comprehensive coverage of Docker-based connector testing.

- Maintained visual consistency across the application

## Testing
- Ran linter to ensure code quality
- Verified changes visually in the local development environment

3183837513,62123,docs: Update SAP HANA connector to document CDC support with trigger-table approach,"
# docs: Update SAP HANA connector to document CDC support with trigger-table approach

## Summary

Updated the SAP HANA source connector documentation to reflect that Change Data Capture (CDC) is now supported and fully functional. The connector uses a sophisticated trigger-based CDC approach that was implemented but not documented.

**Key Changes:**
- Changed CDC status from ""in-development"" to ""supported"" in features table
- Added comprehensive CDC section explaining trigger-table implementation
- Documented CDC configuration options, prerequisites, and limitations  
- Added Reference section with programmatic configuration examples
- Fixed typo in features table (""Changa"" → ""Change"")

The documentation is based on analysis of the actual CDC implementation in the airbyte-enterprise repository, including `TriggerTableConfig.kt`, `SapHanaSourceCdcIntegrationTest.kt`, and configuration specifications.

## Review & Testing Checklist for Human
- [ ] **Test CDC functionality end-to-end** - Verify CDC actually works as documented by setting up a SAP HANA source with CDC enabled and confirming it captures INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE operations correctly
- [ ] **Validate configuration examples** - Check that the JSON configuration examples in the Reference section use correct field names and syntax that match the actual connector specification
- [ ] **Verify documentation rendering** - Confirm the new CDC section and Reference section render properly on the documentation site without formatting issues
- [ ] **Test trigger table behavior** - Verify that trigger tables are created with the documented naming convention (`_ab_cdc._ab_trigger_{schema}_{table}`) and contain the documented meta fields
- [ ] **Confirm prerequisites completeness** - Validate that all documented database permissions and setup requirements are necessary and sufficient for CDC to work

**Recommended test plan:** Set up a test SAP HANA database, configure the connector with CDC enabled, make some data changes, and verify the sync captures those changes with the documented cursor field and trigger table structure.

- https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/pull/62435
- https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/pull/62133 (this pr)
- https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte-python-cdk/pull/627

# Point MotherDuck destination to CDK dev branch with primary key fix

## Summary

This PR updates the MotherDuck destination to use a development branch of the Airbyte Python CDK that contains a fix for primary key handling in SQL destinations. The original issue was that the `CatalogProvider.get_primary_keys()` method was ignoring source-defined primary keys when configured primary keys were empty/None, affecting all SQL destinations including MotherDuck.

**Dependencies**: This PR depends on CDK PR [#627](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte-python-cdk/pull/627) which implements the actual fix.

**Changes Made**:
- Updated `pyproject.toml` to point `airbyte-cdk` dependency to dev branch `devin/1751064114-fix-primary-key-fallback`
- Added `poethepoet` as dev dependency (required for the poe task used to update CDK reference)
- Updated `poetry.lock` with new dependency resolution

## Review & Testing Checklist for Human

⚠️ **MEDIUM RISK** - Dependency change affecting core destination functionality

- [ ] **End-to-end testing**: Test MotherDuck destination with actual data to verify primary key handling works correctly, especially with deduplication sync modes
- [ ] **Primary key scenario testing**: Create test cases with configured catalogs having empty `primary_key` but non-empty `source_defined_primary_key` to verify fallback behavior
- [ ] **Regression testing**: Verify existing MotherDuck functionality still works (no breaking changes from CDK update)
- [ ] **Dependency management review**: Confirm using a CDK dev branch is appropriate for this testing scenario and understand the merge/release plan

### Recommended Test Plan
1. Set up MotherDuck destination with test data
2. Create configured catalogs with various primary key combinations:
   - Streams with only configured primary keys (should use configured)
   - Streams with empty configured primary keys but source-defined ones (should fall back)
   - Streams with neither (should handle gracefully)
3. Run sync operations with deduplication modes that rely on primary keys
4. Verify SQL generation and data integrity

### Notes

- **Coordination required**: This PR creates a testing branch for the MotherDuck destination that depends on an unmerged CDK fix
- **Temporary state**: This dependency on a dev branch should be reverted once CDK PR #627 is merged and a new CDK version is released
- **Testing scope**: While this PR only affects MotherDuck destination configuration, the underlying CDK fix affects all SQL destinations
- **CI considerations**: Some CI checks may fail due to the dev branch dependency until the CDK PR is merged

3196479981,431,Add monthly dividend report CSV job,"
# Add monthly dividend report CSV job

## Summary

This PR implements a new monthly dividend report system that automatically generates and emails CSV reports of dividend payment data to accounting recipients. The implementation follows the existing consolidated invoice CSV pattern but focuses specifically on dividend data without recipient names.

**Key Components:**
- `DividendReportCsv` service generates CSV reports with client-level dividend summaries
- `DividendReportCsvEmailJob` Sidekiq job runs monthly on the 1st at 4 PM UTC
- CSV includes: dates, client names, total dividends, Flexile fees (2.9% + 30¢ capped at $30), transfer fees, ACH pull amounts
- Emails sent to Steven Olson and Howard Yu (updated per GitHub comments)
- Proper date range filtering to capture only the previous month's dividend rounds

## Review & Testing Checklist for Human

- [ ] **Verify Flexile fee calculation logic** - Confirm 2.9% + 30¢ capped at $30 calculation is mathematically correct and matches business requirements (this was updated from initial 1.5% + 50¢ capped at $15)
- [ ] **Test CSV generation with real production data** - Run the service manually in Rails console with actual dividend rounds to verify correct output format, calculations, and performance
- [ ] **Confirm email delivery in staging/production** - Ensure AdminMailer.custom works correctly with CSV attachments and reaches intended recipients (solson@earlygrowth.com, howard@antiwork.com)
- [ ] **Review database query performance** - Check that the complex joins and filtering perform adequately with production data volumes
- [ ] **Validate monthly scheduling timing** - Verify that the 1st of month at 4 PM UTC timing aligns with accounting workflow needs

**Recommended Test Plan:**
1. Run `DividendReportCsv.new(DividendRound.where(""issued_at >= ? AND issued_at <= ?"", 1.month.ago.beginning_of_month, 1.month.ago.end_of_month)).generate` in Rails console
2. Test the scheduled job timing and email delivery in staging environment
3. Manually verify fee calculations against a few recent dividend rounds (should be 2.9% + 30¢, capped at $30)
4. Check query performance with production data volumes

### Notes

- **Environment limitation**: Could not fully test due to Redis connection issues in test environment - manual testing in production/staging is essential
- **Fee calculation updated**: Changed from 1.5% + 50¢ capped at $15 to 2.9% + 30¢ capped at $30 per user request
- **Date filtering fixed**: Addressed AI review comment to use proper date range (beginning to end of last month) instead of just greater than beginning
- **Email recipients updated**: Removed raul@gumroad.com and added howard@antiwork.com per GitHub comment
- **Data scope**: Report includes only dividend rounds with successful payments from the previous month
- **CI status**: All checks passing (6 pass, 0 fail, 2 skipping)

3134862968,358,Convert DataTable to regular Table component in invoice page,"# Convert DataTable to regular Table component in invoice page

## Summary
Converted the `DataTable` component at line 285 in `frontend/app/invoices/[id]/page.tsx` to a regular `Table` component, following the pattern established in `frontend/app/invoices/Edit.tsx` line 357.

## Changes Made
- **Removed DataTable dependencies**: Removed imports for `DataTable`, `createColumnHelper`, and `useTable` from `@/components/DataTable`
- **Added Table component imports**: Added `Table`, `TableBody`, `TableCell`, `TableHead`, `TableHeader`, `TableRow` from `@/components/ui/table`
- **Replaced DataTable usage**: Converted the DataTable component to a manual Table structure with proper header and body sections
- **Maintained functionality**: Preserved all existing column logic, conditional rendering for project-based vs hourly contractors, and data formatting
- **Cleaned up unused code**: Removed unused type definitions (`Invoice`, `InvoiceLineItem`) and `RouterOutput` import

## Technical Details
- The table now manually maps over `invoice.lineItems` instead of using the DataTable's table prop
- Conditional column rendering is preserved (Hours and Cash rate columns only show for non-project-based contractors)
- All existing data formatting functions (`formatDuration`, `formatMoneyFromCents`) and styling classes (`text-right`, `tabular-nums`) are maintained
- The `cashFactor` calculation remains unchanged

## Testing
- ✅ Code passes ESLint with no warnings or errors
- ⚠️ Local testing was blocked by Vercel CLI configuration issue, but the conversion follows the established Table pattern used elsewhere in the codebase

3101582715,60991,"docs(source-xero): improve documentation with detailed authentication, sync behavior, and error handling information","# Xero Source Connector Documentation Improvements

This PR improves the documentation for the Xero source connector by adding more detailed information about authentication, sync behavior, error handling, and other important aspects of the connector.

## What's Changed

3143883658,364,Integrate Helper chat widget with authentication,"# Helper Chat Widget Integration

This PR integrates the Helper.ai chat widget into the Flexile Next.js application with proper authentication and user metadata support.

## Changes Made

### Core Integration
- **Installed @helperai/react package** for Helper widget functionality
- **Added HelperWrapper component** (`frontend/components/HelperWrapper.tsx`) that dynamically handles user authentication
- **Updated root layout** (`frontend/app/layout.tsx`) to use HelperWrapper instead of direct HelperProvider
- **Created API route** (`frontend/app/api/helper-auth/route.ts`) for server-side Helper authentication token generation
- **Added utility function** (`frontend/utils/helper-auth.ts`) for Helper authentication logic

### Configuration
- **Host**: `https://help.gumroad.com`
- **Mailbox Slug**: `flexile`
- **Authentication**: Uses existing Clerk authentication system with `useCurrentUser` hook
- **User Metadata**: Includes user name and profile links in Helper configuration
- **Environment Variables**: Added `HELPER_HMAC_SECRET` and `HELPER_MAILBOX_SLUG` to .env (not committed)

### Technical Implementation
- **Dynamic Authentication**: Widget only loads with authentication when user is logged in
- **Graceful Fallback**: Provides anonymous session configuration when authentication fails
- **TypeScript Support**: Proper typing based on @helperai/react package definitions
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for authentication failures

## Testing Status

⚠️ **Local Testing Limitation**: Unable to test widget functionality in browser due to Vercel CLI configuration issue preventing development server startup. The `bin/dev` command fails with:
```
Error: Could not retrieve Project Settings. To link your Project, remove the `.vercel` directory and deploy again.
```

**Code Quality**: TypeScript compilation shows no errors related to Helper integration (existing errors are pre-existing SVG import issues unrelated to this work).

## Next Steps

1. **Environment Setup**: Need help resolving Vercel configuration to enable local testing
2. **Widget Testing**: Once dev server runs, verify widget appears and functions correctly
3. **User Flow Testing**: Test authentication flow and user metadata display
4. **Contextual Help**: Consider adding contextual help buttons using `useHelper` hook if needed

3144011143,367,Remove QuickBooks financial report sync jobs and related UI components,"# Remove QuickBooks Financial Report Sync Jobs and Related UI Components

## Summary
This PR removes the QuickBooks financial report sync functionality as requested, including:
- `QuickbooksCompanyFinancialReportSyncJob` & `QuickbooksMonthlyFinancialReportSyncJob` backend classes
- Monthly scheduled job that runs on the 20th to pull revenue and net income from QuickBooks
- All UI components in company updates that reference financial report sync functionality

## Changes Made

### Backend Changes
- **Removed scheduled job**: Deleted `quickbooks_monthly_financial_report_sync_job` from Sidekiq schedule configuration
- **Deleted job classes**: Removed `QuickbooksCompanyFinancialReportSyncJob` and `QuickbooksMonthlyFinancialReportSyncJob` files
- **Updated service classes**: Removed financial report logic from `CreateOrUpdateCompanyUpdate` service
- **Cleaned up models**: Removed financial report associations and methods from `Company` and `CompanyUpdate` models
- **Updated presenters**: Removed financial report methods from `CompanyUpdatePresenter`
- **Cleaned up seed data**: Removed financial report generation from seed data services

### Frontend Changes
- **Removed Inngest function**: Deleted `quickbooksFinancialReportSync` function and related integrations
- **Deleted UI component**: Removed `FinancialOverview` component used in company updates
- **Updated tRPC routes**: Removed `financialReports` router and cleaned up `companyUpdates` routes
- **Simplified forms**: Removed financial overview fields from company update creation/editing forms
- **Updated email templates**: Removed financial overview sections from company update emails
- **Cleaned up integrations**: Removed financial report sync triggers from QuickBooks integration workflows

### Documentation
- **Updated QuickBooks docs**: Removed references to financial report sync jobs

## Database Considerations
- Preserved `CompanyMonthlyFinancialReport` database model and migration per repository guidelines
- Set financial report fields to null/false in company updates rather than removing columns

## Testing
- ✅ Lint checks pass with no ESLint warnings or errors
- ✅ All imports and references cleaned up to prevent broken dependencies
- ✅ Company update workflow preserved while removing financial report functionality

## Verification
The application should continue to work normally with company updates, but without any financial report sync functionality or UI components. All scheduled jobs related to QuickBooks financial reporting have been removed.

2814132697,3591,feat: add configurable width to mo.sidebar() (#3570),"Fixes #3570
Fixes #2893

Add configurable width to mo.sidebar()

This PR adds the ability to configure the sidebar width through the `mo.sidebar()` API. Users can now specify any valid CSS width value (e.g., ""300px"", ""20rem"", ""50%"") to control the width of the sidebar when it's open.

Changes:
- Add `width` parameter to `mo.sidebar()` Python API
- Implement width configuration through `data-width` attribute
- Add unit tests for width configuration

Example usage:
```python
mo.sidebar(content, width=""400px"")  # Set sidebar width to 400px
mo.sidebar(content, width=""20rem"")  # Set sidebar width using rem units
```

The closed sidebar width remains fixed at 68px for consistency.

3204805042,442,Fix autofix.ci workflow by excluding .github directory from linting,"
# Fix autofix.ci workflow by excluding .github directory from linting

## Summary

This PR fixes the autofix.ci workflow failure that was occurring when the action tried to modify `.github/copilot-instructions.md`. The autofix.ci action is not allowed to modify files in the `.github` directory due to GitHub's security restrictions (missing `workflow` permission).

**Changes made:**
- Added `.github` to the ESLint ignores configuration in `eslint.config.js`
- Added `.github` to the Prettier ignore patterns in `.prettierignore`

This follows the established best practice documented in the [lint-action repository](https://github.com/wearerequired/lint-action), which explicitly states: ""Make sure to exclude the `.github` directory in your ESLint and Prettier configs as the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` cannot be used to update workflow files due to the missing `workflow` permission.""

## Review & Testing Checklist for Human

- [ ] **Verify autofix.ci workflow runs successfully** - Check that this PR's autofix.ci workflow completes without the previous error about not being allowed to modify the `.github` directory
- [ ] **Test linting commands still work** - Run `bin/lint` locally to ensure the configuration changes don't break existing linting functionality
- [ ] **Confirm .github files are properly excluded** - Verify that ESLint and Prettier no longer process files in the `.github` directory when running locally

### Notes

This fix resolves the error mentioned in the Slack message from the `#flexile` channel where autofix.ci was failing with:
```
##[error]The autofix.ci action is not allowed to modify the .github directory.
```

The solution is minimal and targeted - we're only adding exclusion patterns to prevent linting tools from processing files in the `.github` directory, which autofix.ci cannot modify due to GitHub's security restrictions.

3025434270,227,Make roles additive rather than restrictive,"# Make roles additive rather than restrictive

This PR implements additive roles, allowing users with multiple roles (CompanyContractor, CompanyAdministrator, CompanyLawyer) to see everything allowed by each role, instead of being restricted to a single role's perspective and causing 404 errors.

## Changes

1. Updated tRPC route files to replace restrictive role checks with additive ones, changing patterns like:
   ```typescript
   if (!ctx.companyAdministrator) throw new TRPCError({ code: ""FORBIDDEN"" });
   ```
   to:
   ```typescript
   if (!(ctx.companyAdministrator || ctx.companyLawyer)) throw new TRPCError({ code: ""FORBIDDEN"" });
   ```

2. Updated frontend components that use `user.activeRole` to check for the presence of specific roles in `user.roles` using:
   ```typescript
   !!user.roles.administrator
   ```
   or
   ```typescript
   (!!user.roles.worker || !!user.roles.investor)
   ```

These changes ensure that users with multiple roles can access everything allowed by any of their roles, eliminating 404 errors when trying to access content.

3160636839,381,Allow equity split changes when allocation is locked,"# Allow equity split changes when allocation is locked

## Summary
This PR removes the disabled conditions for equity split inputs when equity allocations are already locked, allowing users to change their equity split selection even after it has been previously locked.

## Changes Made
- **Quick Invoice Form**: Removed the `!!equityAllocation?.locked` condition from the disabled prop of the equity split RangeInput component
- **Invoice Edit Form**: Removed the `!equityAllocation?.locked` condition to show the equity split section even when allocation is locked
- **Backend Call Logic**: Removed the `!data.equity_allocation?.is_locked` condition to allow equity percentage updates for locked allocations

## Files Modified
- `frontend/app/invoices/page.tsx` - Updated quick invoice equity split input
- `frontend/app/invoices/Edit.tsx` - Updated invoice edit form equity split section and backend call logic

## Testing
- Lint checks passed successfully with no ESLint warnings or errors
- Local testing was attempted but blocked by Vercel CLI configuration issues in the development environment

3253345747,608,Update pay rate validation error message to be more user-friendly,"# Update pay rate validation error message to be more user-friendly

## Summary

Updated the validation error message for `pay_rate_in_subunits` in the `CompanyWorker` model from the technical message ""Pay rate in subunits must be greater than 0"" to a more user-friendly message ""Please enter a rate above $0."" This change makes the error more actionable and clearer for end users.

**Files changed:**
- `backend/app/models/company_worker.rb`: Updated validation message parameter
- `backend/spec/services/invite_worker_spec.rb`: Updated test expectation to match new message

## Review & Testing Checklist for Human

**⚠️ Risk Level: Yellow - Manual verification required due to limited local testing**

- [ ] **Verify test passes in CI** - The updated test in `invite_worker_spec.rb` should pass with the new error message
- [ ] **Test the actual user flow** - Try inviting a contractor with a negative or zero pay rate to verify the new error message appears correctly in the UI
- [ ] **Check for other error message locations** - Search the frontend/UI code to see if this error message appears elsewhere and needs updating
- [ ] **Verify currency formatting** - Confirm that ""$0"" is appropriate for all locales and contexts where this validation occurs

**Recommended test plan:**
1. Run the specific test: `bundle exec rspec spec/services/invite_worker_spec.rb:145`
2. In the actual application, attempt to invite a contractor with pay rate set to 0 or negative value
3. Verify the error message displays as ""Please enter a rate above $0."" in the UI

## Summary
Updates development documentation to include two new requirements based on Slack feedback from #flexile channel:

1. **Schema synchronization rule**: Any Rails migrations that change the database schema must have corresponding updates to `frontend/db/schema.ts` for type safety
2. **PR self-review guideline**: Contributors should self-review their PRs with explanatory comments for non-intuitive changes to help reviewers understand the reasoning

The schema sync rule is added to both `.cursorrules` and `.github/copilot-instructions.md` to maintain consistency. The PR guideline is inserted as a new numbered step in the existing Pull Request workflow in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

## Review & Testing Checklist for Human
- [ ] Verify the schema synchronization rule accurately describes the relationship between Rails migrations and frontend schema updates
- [ ] Confirm the PR self-review guideline is placed appropriately in the contribution workflow and is clearly worded

3270717497,652,Add comprehensive component guidance to copilot instructions and cursor rules,"# Add comprehensive component guidance to copilot instructions and cursor rules

## Summary

Added comprehensive component guidance to both `.github/copilot-instructions.md` and `.cursorrules` files to help developers discover and use existing components from the `frontend/components/` folder. The guidance includes 50+ components organized into 6 categories:

- **UI Components (Shadcn/UI primitives)**: Button, Input, Textarea, Dialog, etc.
- **Custom Form Components**: ComboBox, NumberInput, DatePicker, etc. 
- **Data Display Components**: DataTable, Placeholder, Status, Delta, etc.
- **Action Components**: MutationButton, CopyButton, Link
- **Layout Components**: DashboardHeader, Tabs, Sidebar, Breadcrumb
- **Specialized Components**: RichText, GettingStarted, TableSkeleton, etc.

This addresses the request to specifically highlight components like Placeholders, DataTables, and Inputs so developers use existing components instead of creating duplicates.

## Review & Testing Checklist for Human

- [ ] **Verify component descriptions are accurate** - Spot-check 3-5 key components (like DataTable, ComboBox, NumberInput) against their actual implementations to ensure descriptions match functionality
- [ ] **Confirm file synchronization** - Verify `.cursorrules` and `.github/copilot-instructions.md` are identical (requirement from existing rules)
- [ ] **Check component coverage** - Review `frontend/components/` folder to see if any important components were missed or miscategorized
- [ ] **Test practical usage** - Try using the guidance in a real development scenario to ensure it's helpful and doesn't conflict with existing workflow

**Recommended test plan**: Create a simple feature using 2-3 components from different categories (e.g., a form with ComboBox + NumberInput displayed in a DataTable) to verify the guidance leads to correct component selection and usage.

3270815465,654,Configure tests workflow to run only on push events,"# Configure tests workflow to run only on push events

## Summary
Modified the GitHub Actions tests workflow configuration to remove the `pull_request` trigger, keeping only the `push` trigger. This change prevents the tests from running automatically when pull requests are opened, synchronized, or reopened, and will only run tests when code is pushed to any branch.

**Files changed:**
- `.github/workflows/tests.yml` - Removed pull_request trigger configuration

## Review & Testing Checklist for Human
- [ ] **Verify this aligns with team workflow expectations** - Confirm that removing automatic test runs on PRs is the intended behavior
- [ ] **Test workflow triggering** - Push a commit to a test branch and verify the tests workflow runs correctly  
- [ ] **Check for workflow dependencies** - Ensure no other workflows or processes depend on tests running automatically on PRs

**Recommended test plan:** Create a test branch, push a commit, and verify the tests workflow triggers. Then create a PR from that branch and confirm tests do NOT trigger automatically.

- Both RSpec and Playwright test jobs are affected by this change
- Consider the impact on development workflow - developers may need to push commits to trigger tests rather than relying on PR-based test runs

2895280174,3977,Fix error serializing dictionary errors,"# Fix error serializing dictionary errors

Fixes #3972 - Error serializing data when a dictionary is passed instead of an Error object with a `.type` attribute.

## Changes
- Modified the `serialize_session_view` function to handle both dictionary and object errors
- Added a test case to verify the fix works for dictionary errors

## Problem
When serializing data, the code was trying to access `error.type` but sometimes `error` was a dictionary rather than an object with a `type` attribute. This caused an error when trying to serialize the data.

## Solution
The fix checks if the error is a dictionary and accesses its properties using dictionary syntax (`error[""type""]`) instead of attribute syntax (`error.type`).

This PR fixes an issue where the AI chat/generation feature shows a false error when streaming responses. The issue occurs when using an OpenAI-compatible API where there's a case where `response.choices[0].delta` is `None`, which causes an AttributeError when trying to access `.content`. The fix adds a check for `response.choices[0].delta` before accessing `.content` in the `get_content` function.

3087035704,60883,docs: add Amazon RDS MySQL binlog retention configuration information,"# Add Amazon RDS MySQL binlog retention configuration information

## Description
This PR adds documentation about Amazon RDS MySQL's specific binlog retention configuration. The customer's feedback highlights that RDS MySQL uses a different parameter (`binlog retention hours`) than standard MySQL (`binlog_expire_logs_seconds`), and this parameter defaults to 0, causing issues with binlogs disappearing before Airbyte can sync them.

The updates include:
1. Adding a note in the main MySQL documentation about the RDS-specific parameter
2. Expanding the troubleshooting guide to include RDS-specific recommendations
3. Including links to the official AWS documentation

## What is the current behavior?
The documentation doesn't mention that Amazon RDS MySQL uses a different parameter for binlog retention configuration.

## What is the new behavior?
The documentation now includes information about:
- RDS MySQL using `binlog retention hours` instead of `binlog_expire_logs_seconds`
- The default value being 0 (meaning binary logs aren't retained)
- The need to increase this value using the RDS-specific procedure
- A link to the AWS documentation

## Customer feedback
This PR addresses feedback from Rob Kerr, who reported that binlogs were disappearing from RDS before Airbyte had time to sync them. The issue was that RDS doesn't use `binlog_expire_logs_seconds` as 'normal' MySQL sources do, but instead uses its own parameter ""binlog retention hours"", which defaults to 0.

3275203640,669,Update Pay Contractors section to highlight 190+ countries support,"# Update Pay Contractors section to highlight 190+ countries support

## Summary
Updated the marketing copy for the ""Pay Contractors"" feature on the homepage to emphasize Flexile's global reach. Changed the description from ""Fast, reliable contractor payments with transparent processing"" to ""Fast, reliable payments to contractors in 190+ countries worldwide"" to better highlight the platform's international payment capabilities.

The 190+ countries claim is based on the backend configuration in `countries.json` which shows 436 countries with `supportsWisePayout: true`.

## Review & Testing Checklist for Human
- [ ] **Visual verification**: Load the homepage and confirm the updated text displays correctly and fits well within the existing grid layout
- [ ] **Responsive design**: Test on mobile and desktop to ensure the longer text doesn't break the layout or cause visual issues
- [ ] **Marketing claim accuracy**: Verify that the ""190+ countries worldwide"" claim aligns with actual product capabilities and current marketing strategy
- [ ] **Consistency check**: Ensure this messaging is consistent with other marketing copy across the site and doesn't conflict with existing messaging

**Recommended test plan**: Visit the homepage, scroll to the features section, and verify the ""Pay Contractors"" item shows the updated text with proper formatting and alignment.

## Summary
Removed `<br/>` tags from 4 locations on the homepage marketing page to improve responsive formatting across different breakpoints. The changes affect the main heading and three feature descriptions, allowing text to flow naturally instead of having forced line breaks that could cause formatting issues on different screen sizes.

**Changed locations:**
- Main ""Contractor payments"" heading  
- ""Pay Contractors"" feature description
- ""Equity Option"" feature description  
- ""Contract Management"" feature description

## Review & Testing Checklist for Human
- [ ] **Visual testing across breakpoints** - Test the homepage on mobile, tablet, and desktop screen sizes to ensure text flows properly without overflow or awkward wrapping
- [ ] **Verify responsive improvement** - Confirm that removing the `<br/>` tags actually fixes the formatting issues mentioned in the original request
- [ ] **Design consistency check** - Ensure the overall visual design and spacing still looks good and maintains consistency with the rest of the page

3260345989,622,Match dividend check pattern to invoice requirements,"# Match dividend check pattern to invoice requirements

## Summary
Updated the dividend signing eligibility check in the equity dividends page to match the pattern used in the invoices system. Changed the condition from checking `user.hasPayoutMethodForDividends && user.legalName` to `user.address.street_address && !!user.taxInformationConfirmedAt`, aligning with the requirement validation used in `frontend/app/(dashboard)/invoices/index.tsx:34`.

This change standardizes the eligibility criteria across the platform, ensuring consistent requirements for users to interact with financial features.

## Review & Testing Checklist for Human
- [ ] **Test dividend signing functionality** - Verify that users who should be able to sign dividend releases can still do so after this change
- [ ] **Check alert message consistency** - The alert messages on lines 145-167 still reference the old conditions (`user.legalName` and `user.hasPayoutMethodForDividends`) and may need updating to match the new logic
- [ ] **Verify data field availability** - Confirm that `user.address.street_address` and `user.taxInformationConfirmedAt` are properly available in the user context for this page
- [ ] **Test edge cases** - Ensure users who don't meet the new criteria are properly blocked from signing, and that the UI behaves correctly in these scenarios

We use [`syft`](https://github.com/anchore/syft) to generate a SBOM for the latest connector version and the one from the PR.
It allows us to spot the dependencies that have been updated at all levels and for all types of dependencies (system, python, java etc.).
Here are the dependencies that have been updated compared to `airbyte/source-tempo:latest`.
Keep in mind that `:latest` does not always match the connector code on the main branch. 
It is the latest released connector image when the head commit of this branch was created.

## Dependency updates

We use [`syft`](https://github.com/anchore/syft) to generate a SBOM for the latest connector version and the one from the PR.
It allows us to spot the dependencies that have been updated at all levels and for all types of dependencies (system, python, java etc.).
Here are the dependencies that have been updated compared to `airbyte/source-zendesk-chat:latest`.
Keep in mind that `:latest` does not always match the connector code on the main branch. 
It is the latest released connector image when the head commit of this branch was created.

We use [`syft`](https://github.com/anchore/syft) to generate a SBOM for the latest connector version and the one from the PR.
It allows us to spot the dependencies that have been updated at all levels and for all types of dependencies (system, python, java etc.).
Here are the dependencies that have been updated compared to `airbyte/source-google-forms:latest`.
Keep in mind that `:latest` does not always match the connector code on the main branch. 
It is the latest released connector image when the head commit of this branch was created.

This was a miss when migration to the latest protocol occurred. We used to check if a match existed, and there seems to be some URIs that don't follow this pattern (like 'https://client_name.sharepoint.com/Pages/some_page.aspx'). I will investigate further but this should mitigate the case.

2542934986,60906,fix(destination-motherduck): Add Unicode-aware normalizer,"Okay, Claude absolutely earned its attribution. It did what I would have done... but faster, and tbh, more thorougly. Do you want this normalizer to be pulled up from the MotherDuck destination to be a reusable utility?

## What
Replaces LowerCaseNormalizer with UnicodeAwareNormalizer in MotherDuck destination connector to preserve Unicode characters in column names while maintaining ASCII compatibility.

- Resolves customer issue with Japanese column names like ""税率""
- Preserves Unicode letters/numbers using Unicode-aware regex
- Maintains existing LowerCaseNormalizer behavior for ASCII inputs
- Adds comprehensive unit tests covering 30 test cases
- Verified DuckDB compatibility with Unicode table names


## User Impact
Hopefully internationalized table names now work. DuckDB supports basically any name you throw at it.

## Can this PR be safely reverted and rolled back?

- [ x ] YES 💚
- [ ] NO ❌

We use [`syft`](https://github.com/anchore/syft) to generate a SBOM for the latest connector version and the one from the PR.
It allows us to spot the dependencies that have been updated at all levels and for all types of dependencies (system, python, java etc.).
Here are the dependencies that have been updated compared to `airbyte/source-genesys:latest`.
Keep in mind that `:latest` does not always match the connector code on the main branch. 
It is the latest released connector image when the head commit of this branch was created.

2282388423,51585,✨feat(source google drive): make file-trasfer,"## What
Implement file-transfer feature for source-google-drive

Resolves [[source-google-drive] Add file transfers support to google drive](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/issues/51540)

- [x] Config option to use file-transfer mode
- [x] In file transfer mode, file filtering glob is still applied
- [x] Fetch all files maching the filters, extract them as the corresponding office format (docx for docs, ditto spreadsheets and presentations, pdf for all else)

Doc ref: [Export MIME types for Google Workspace documents](https://developers.google.com/drive/api/guides/ref-export-formats)

| Google MIME Type                                  | Equivalent MIME Type for export                                     | File Extension |
|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|----------------|

- [x] Transfer these raw files with file transfers mode, do NOT put them thorugh unstructured flow. 
   @natikgadzhi To be more precise about this point, ""Unstructured,"" along with other options, is a format type that we only support for transfer records mode, and format is ignored for transfer files; if in the future we want to have unstructured or any other format supported when transferring files some extra work would be required.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b731b06c-4e46-4314-9ec5-e262d1d7b73d)
 
- [x] Using unstructured.io is still available in the flow that exists today

## How
It updated the spec to show the option that leverages cdk logic to handle the new record type and add `file_size()` and `get_file()` to the stream reader.

## Review guide

1. `airbyte-integrations/connectors/source-google-drive/source_google_drive/stream_reader.py`:  file_size() and get_file() to the stream reader, also updates on `_get_export_mime_type` and `_is_exportable_document`.
2. `airbyte-integrations/connectors/source-google-drive/integration_tests/spec.json`: update spec.
3. `docs/integrations/sources/google-drive.md`: updated doc.
4. `airbyte-integrations/connectors/source-google-drive/metadata.yaml`: updated base image as old couldn't handle python 3.10.


## User Impact

If they just need to move files as they are, this will greatly improve users' experience as sync will be quite fast.

/cc @eerhardt

## Customer Impact

Customers are unable to use Azure AppInsights, OpenAI, and CosmosDB existing resources. It will always try provisioning new resources even when calling ""AsExisting"". For Azure Redis, using AsExisting doesn't work because the bicep fails to deploy since we are setting properties on an existing resource. See https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/bicep-core-diagnostics#BCP173

## Testing

New bicep tests for these scenarios added.

## Risk

Low. Since we are changing the bicep generation code to support existing resources, we may affect the bicep generation of new resources. But existing bicep baseline tests are passing. The only test that required a change was for AppInsights, but that is a simple resource reordering in bicep, which shouldn't affect it.

2514810750,9264,Fix visibility updates during resource upserts,"## Description

Previously, when upserting a resource, the visibility function passed to `UpdateFromResource` would return false in the event that any value in the dictionary was false. For example, if `container` and `project` are values, `container` is marked as hidden (false), and then a resource of type `project` is updated, `project` will then be set to hidden. This is incorrect. Instead, the value should be visible if it was previously visible in the dictionary or if it's new (ie, when stopping a command, you may see the state `Stopping` for the first time).

Fixes #9220

Note that this recursive search behavior can be expensive in projects with a large number of *.csproj files so it is possible to place a `.aspire/settings.json` file in the current directory or any parent directory to short-circuit the discovery process and point directly to a well known apphost.

- Adds icons to the resource grid that are the same as the ones from the graph.
- Hides the resource type column, resource type can be toggled in options and is the tooltip for the icon.

I started out thinking about how to add custom icons for a resource, so that Redis for example could use the Redis logo. This felt like a good first part of that. After this, if we want, we can add an annotation for an icon and add it to the protocol. Then this would be the fallback for when there is no custom icon or if the resource server doesn't implement custom icons. A dashboard running in prod would not have the icons for example.

I thought this PR would at least let us talk about if we want to do this or not and start progressing on the idea.

Some notes:

- Size: technically we should probably request a size from the icon helper and have it return the right Icon for that size since the actual icon can and does change for each size. However not all the icons exist for all sizes and the differences didn't seem to make a huge deal. So I left the size as the same one as we use in the graph and reduce it with styles.
- Color: I would have liked to not use WithColor and therefore avoid instantiating a new icon for each invocation, but it wasn't obvious to me how to do that with FluentIcon component. All the things I tried got messed with in some way. Maybe someone else can tell me.

2299225316,7261,Refactor health check service to be more responsive,"## Description

Fixes https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/issues/6112

The health check service immediately checks health when a resource moves to a running state. However, if the intial report is unhealthy then it waits 5 seconds before checking again. This PR refactors the health check service to be more responsive.

* If a health report isn't healthy then the delay interval starts at 1 second and increases by 1 second per failure up to the existing 5 sec. Healthy delay is still 30 seconds.
* Refactored the health check loop to use an instant interrupt instead of polling the state once per second. The `DelayAsync` method is complicated, but the actual health monitoring loop is much simpler.
* Allow setting the health delays from tests so time based tests run a lot faster. No more 30 second tests.
* No more blocking in tests: `AutoResetEvent` 👎

2502936258,9133,Make WithHttpHealthCheck work like WithHttpCommand,"## Description

Obsoletes `WithHttpsHealthCheck` and changes `WithHttpHealthCheck` to work like `WithHttpCommand` WRT endpoint selection (i.e. it defaults to using the first endpoint with an `https` scheme, then falls back to the first endpoint with an `http` scheme, unless a specific endpoint name or selector function is passed in).

2506414799,9159,Update health check to ensure blob containers created at right time,"

Resolves #9139
Resolves #9145

The underlying issue is attributed to a lack of health checks for child resources (as those have no lifetime of their own). In the nutshell, whenever an Azurite emulator is starting up, the readiness of the emulator is indicated by the readiness of the ""blobs"" resources (represented by `BloblServiceClient`). Previously, child blob contrainers were created on `ResourceReadyEvent`, but this created an opportunity for a race condition - a client could attempt to connect _after_ the resource reported healthy but _before_ child resources were created - the flaky test highlighted this problem.

To fix the issue we're now creating an individual health check for each blob container resource. To make it simple, a blob container is being created within the health check itself.",Human,4403806,RussKie,closed,2025-05-08T08:30:25Z,2025-05-16T18:20:58Z,2025-05-16T18:20:58Z,,https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/aspire,https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/pull/9159,human,,https://github.com/dotnet/aspire,,dotnet/aspire,C#,763.0,5255.0

2456461996,15298,Migrate the legacy `mlflow.evaluation.Assessment` to the new `mlflow.entity.Assessment`,"### What changes are proposed in this pull request?

Taking over https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/15191. 

The `mlflow.evaluation.Assessment` will be deprecated in favor of the new `mlflow.entity.Assessment`. However, we cannot remove it in 2.x because there are some important usage in DBX such as Agent Evaluation. Therefore, this PR make non-breaking adjustments so that those use cases can migrate to 3.x smoothly.

Also, the `trace_id` and timestamp fields in the new `mlflow.entity.Assessment` entity becomes optional, so that users can create a stand-alone Assessment object. This is a valid use case of Agent Evaluation, so supporting it is necessary to make migration happen. For example, [a custom metric definition](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/generative-ai/agent-evaluation/custom-metrics) that returns a stand-alone Assessment object (which will be later logged to backend by evaluator).

The following code ends up calling `get_experiment(None)`:

```
import mlflow


mlflow.set_tracking_uri(""databricks"")
mlflow.set_experiment(""/users/harutaka.kawamura@databricks.com/test-test"")
#                       ^ must be capitalized
```

and throws:

```
mlflow.exceptions.RestException: RESOURCE_DOES_NOT_EXIST: Could not find experiment with ID None.
```

Instead, it should fail with the root cause which is `/users/harutaka.kawamura@databricks.com` does not exist.

### What changes are proposed in this pull request?

Fixed linting errors in GenAI documentation by replacing non-existent `mlflow.active_experiment()` function calls with proper `mlflow.start_run()` pattern. The changes affect connection verification examples in the connect-environment.mdx file, making them use valid MLflow API calls and simplifying the code structure.

### How is this PR tested?

- [x] Existing unit/integration tests

Verified that clint linter passes without MLflow function errors after the changes.

### What changes are proposed in this pull request?

The `__init__` file for flavors are massive. This is ok, but becomes a challenge for the lightweight tracing SDK, because doing `mlflow.openai.autolog()` imports everything defined in the `mlflow/openai/__init__.py`, including various model logging dependencies.

On the other hand, a good example is DSPy flavor, which organize code well and keep `__init__.py` clean.

This PR moves model logging code from `__init__.py` to `model.py` so we can later choose to import or not inside the `__init__.py`. This only updates three flavors that are problematic for tracing SDK: `openai`, `langchain`, and `llama_index`, but we can apply same to other flavors later.

**Note**: This PR targets to **mlflow-3** branch rather than the feature branch, because this will cause huge merge conflict otherwise.

### What changes are proposed in this pull request?

#### Problem
https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/16004 added `@trace_disabled` tag to scorers execution. This was for making sure custom scorers do not generate traces in evaluation run. Currently, the evaluation result page simply show all traces in the Run, so having such extra traces breaks the result and metric aggregation.

However, the above change caused a thread-safety problem. In evaluation harness, model prediction and scorer execution is done concurrently in a thread pool for performance optimization. Trace disabling is global, not thread local, so the above disablement logic sometimes causes side effect that predict_fn does not generate traces. This is a regression.

#### Short-term Solution (this PR)

Unfortunately, disabling tracing in thread-local way is quite challenging. Therefore, we take the following approach as a short-term fix.
1. Just let traces generated from scorers.
2. Once evaluation harness completes, run `mlflow.search_traces()` to get traces in the evaluation run.
3. Traces generated from predict function always have `eval.requestId` tag. Therefore, we can determine extra traces by checking the existence of this tag.
4. Delete these extra traces by calling `mlflow.delete_traces()`.

#### Long-term Solution

From product perspective, we should actually allow those extra traces to be generated. For example, users may want to check the OpenAI LLM call inside their LLM-as-a-Judge scorers.

Therefore, the fundamental problem is how we display evaluation results. It should not just show all traces in the run, but instead filter them by certain criteria e.g. if the trace has assessment created by the evaluation. Post-DAIS, we will change how traces are associated with Run and how evaluation result page fetches list of traces to show. After that change, we should be able to remove this hack.

        {{
            ""harmful"": true
            ""reason"": ""The text contains harmful content""
        }}

        Do not output any other characters than the json object.

        messages=[{""role"": ""user"", ""content"": prompt}],
    )
    payload = json.loads(response.choices[0].message.content)
    return Feedback(value=payload[""harmful""], rationale=payload[""reason""])


# Use the scorer in an evaluation
mlflow.genai.evaluate(
    data=[
        {
            ""inputs"": {""question"": ""What is MLflow?""},
            ""outputs"": I don't know"",
            ""expectations"": {""expected_response"": ""MLflow is an MLOps platform.""}
        },
        {
            ""inputs"": {""question"": ""What is Spark?""},

            ""expectations"": {""expected_response"": ""Spark is a distributed computing engine""}
        },
    ] * 10,
    scorers=[harmfulness, Correctness()],
)
```

The result has exactly 20 traces:

### What changes are proposed in this pull request?

While testing review app, I found `mlflow.search_traces()` doesn't handle traces written from Review App properly.

```
TypeError: 'float' object cannot be interpreted as an integer
File <command-6122023941645961>, line 1
----> 1 mlflow.search_traces(run_id=my_session.mlflow_run_id)
```

After closer look, the start time of the span is set to be `float` somehow. This is a bug in review app side (they log json directly), but adding casting in mlflow side to fix it immediately.

### What changes are proposed in this pull request?
As title: make PythonModel with type hints work in spark_udf
Critical changes:
1. Allow MapType in spark_udf
2. pandas_udf might implicitly convert lists into numpy arrays, so we need to convert it back before validating data against type hint
3. Refactor a bit by reusing pydantic_utils

### What changes are proposed in this pull request?

Sometimes when running the build-docs job via release pipeline, Maven central rate-limits us, causing the job to fail. To avoid this, we write a temporary `/tmp/settings.xml` file and pass it to maven via `mvn ... -s /tmp/settings.xml`.

In order to get this extra option to the maven command, it seems most convenient to read it from an env var.

### What changes are proposed in this pull request?

**Issue**:  There was an inconsistency between the Python variable name (MLFLOW_CONFIGURE_LOGGING) and the environment variable name it checked for (MLFLOW_LOGGING_CONFIGURE_LOGGING).
**Fix**: I have updated the code in environment_variables.py to make the Python variable check for MLFLOW_CONFIGURE_LOGGING environment  variable instead, aligning the names.
**Testing**: I have added test_mlflow_configure_logging_env_var() to tests/utils/test_logging_utils.py that verifies:
    - When MLFLOW_CONFIGURE_LOGGING=False, MLflow doesn't configure loggers
    - When MLFLOW_CONFIGURE_LOGGING=True, MLflow does configure loggers

### What changes are proposed in this pull request?

It is common for DSPy models to receive multiple arguments, but MLflow DSPy flavor does not allow models to receive multiple arguments. Therefore, the following code does not currently work.

```
import mlflow
import dspy

mlflow.set_experiment(""DSPy"")

lm = dspy.LM(""openai/gpt-4o-mini"")
dspy.settings.configure(lm=lm)

dspy_program = dspy.ChainOfThought(""question, context -> answer"")

with mlflow.start_run():
    model_info = mlflow.dspy.log_model(
        dspy_program,
        ""dspy_program"",
        input_example={
            ""question"": ""What is LLM agent?"",
            ""context"": ""LLM agents are a type of AI agent that use LLMs to make decisions."",
        },
    )
```
This PR remove the limitation by converting a Dataframe into a dict.

2329914697,3755,feat: top level functions,"## 📝 Summary

Adds top level functions

 - `@app.fn` (but maybe `app.function` is better) to wrap functions, register them but leave them directly exposed
 - Serialize to `@app.fn` if there are no dependencies
 
 Just an intro PR for #2293

For completion of 2293, I think out standing changes are:
 - [ ] some UI aspect (maybe a new language toggle?)
 - [ ] Top level imports
 - [ ] Looser requirements for serialization (can use imports and other app.fns)

But this is hidden under `App(_toplevel_fn=True)`

## 🔍 Description of Changes

see the smoke test or:

```python
@app.fn
def self_ref_fib(n: int) -> int:
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    return self_ref_fib(n - 1) + self_ref_fib(n - 2)


@app.fn(disabled=True, hide_code=True)
def divide(x, y):
    return y / x


@app.fn
def subtraction(a: ""int"", b: ""int"") -> ""int"":
    return a - b


@app.fn
# Comments inbetween
def multiply(a, b) -> ""int"":
    return a * b


@app.fn
def addition(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    # int is considered no good, re-eval
    return a + b

### Release Notes

<details>
<summary>vitejs/vite-plugin-react (@&#8203;vitejs/plugin-react)</summary>

### [`v4.5.2`](https://redirect.github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/HEAD/packages/plugin-react/CHANGELOG.md#452-2025-06-10)

[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/compare/2f3205265904ff7770021700689a0d6fe17b1f03...bfb45addb83ebae8feebdb75be2e07ce27e916cb)

##### Suggest `@vitejs/plugin-react-oxc` if rolldown-vite is detected [#&#8203;491](https://redirect.github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/pull/491)

Emit a log which recommends `@vitejs/plugin-react-oxc` when `rolldown-vite` is detected to improve performance and use Oxc under the hood. The warning can be disabled by setting `disableOxcRecommendation: false` in the plugin options.

##### Use `optimizeDeps.rollupOptions` instead of `optimizeDeps.esbuildOptions` for rolldown-vite [#&#8203;489](https://redirect.github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/pull/489)

This suppresses the warning about `optimizeDeps.esbuildOptions` being deprecated in rolldown-vite.

##### Add Vite 7-beta to peerDependencies range [#&#8203;497](https://redirect.github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/pull/497)

React plugins are compatible with Vite 7, this removes the warning when testing the beta.

### [`v4.5.1`](https://redirect.github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/HEAD/packages/plugin-react/CHANGELOG.md#451-2025-06-03)

[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/compare/476e705375ef618458918580beb63f43799d12e4...2f3205265904ff7770021700689a0d6fe17b1f03)

##### Add explicit semicolon in preambleCode [#&#8203;485](https://redirect.github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/pull/485)

This fixes an edge case when using HTML minifiers that strips line breaks aggressively.

-->
Previously, code editor would not refresh when you pass a new value, which I'm not sure is intentional. If this is a breaking change, maybe we can introduce a new argument.

Try:
```python
mo.ui.code_editor(value=""HELLO"")
```
Then, change to:
```python
mo.ui.code_editor(value=""HIYA"")
```
The output will still be the old value of HELLO.

2616153484,5436,dev: Use islands as local asset server,"## 📝 Summary

quarto `0.14.7` is broken.

I'm having trouble confirming this is the issue by replicating it locally, since I can't replicate the breakage. My dev served assets seem to work in general. But `being islands` != `being wasm` as is, and I think some of the logic around sockets gets lost (0.14.6 works, so this may be the offending PR: #5403)

2609204234,5399,[Windows] Fix `Copy Path` and `Copy Relative Path` returning identical results.,"## 📝 Summary

Fix #5395 

## 🔍 Description of Changes

Both copy path options in the file explorer's (View File sidebar panel) context menu were returning the same absolute path on Windows systems. The relative path should show only the portion relative to the workspace root, not the full/absolute path.

Fixed by replacing the slash logic with a new `withTrailingDelimiter` method that uses the existing `PathBuilder.deliminator` to append the correct path separator accordingly.

Added tests covering both Unix and Windows path scenarios.

**Before**: Both options returned `D:\full\path\to\file.py`  
**After**: Copy Path returns `D:\full\path\to\file.py`, Copy Relative Path returns `subfolder\file.py`

2621043364,414,Remove redundant validation check in invoice service,"
# Remove redundant validation check in invoice service

## Summary

This PR fixes HTTP 422 errors when submitting invoices by removing a redundant validation check in `CreateOrUpdateInvoiceService`. The service was performing an `all_values_present` check that duplicated model-level validations, causing generic ""Please input all values"" errors instead of the more specific model validation messages like ""Invoice line items description can't be blank"".

**Changes made:**
- Removed lines 16-21 in `CreateOrUpdateInvoiceService` containing the redundant `all_values_present` validation
- Updated test expectations in shared example group to expect the actual model validation error message
- Both RSpec test failures are now resolved

## Review & Testing Checklist for Human

- [ ] **Verify model validations are sufficient** - Confirm that `InvoiceLineItem` model validations properly handle all the validation cases that were previously covered by the service-level check
- [ ] **Test invoice submission end-to-end** - Submit an invoice with missing/empty description field via the frontend to ensure the error message is user-friendly and actionable
- [ ] **Check for other dependencies** - Search codebase for any other places that might expect or handle the ""Please input all values"" error message
- [ ] **Verify error message consistency** - Ensure the new error message ""Invoice line items description can't be blank"" matches the pattern of other validation errors in the system

**Recommended test plan:** Try submitting the original failing invoice payload `{""invoice"":{""invoice_date"":""2025-06-26""},""invoice_line_items"":[{""description"":""-"",""pay_rate_in_subunits"":1200000,""quantity"":1,""hourly"":false}]}` and verify it now returns a helpful error message instead of HTTP 422 with generic text.

### Notes

- The Playwright test failure in CI is unrelated to this change (tax settings UI issue)
- This change should improve user experience by providing more specific error messages
- The removed validation was checking `item.values.all?(&:present?)` which was too broad and prevented proper model validation errors from surfacing

2499417735,263,Add check for bank account presence in `PayInvestorDividends` before processing payments,"This PR addresses a `NoMethodError` occurring in the `PayInvestorDividends`. The error `undefined method 'currency' for nil` happened when the job attempted to process dividend payments for investors who had completed tax verification but had not yet added a bank account for receiving dividends.

The fix involves adding a check for `user.bank_account_for_dividends.nil?` to the early return condition within the job's perform method. This ensures that the job does not proceed if the user lacks a designated bank account, preventing the downstream error.",Human,1855287,raulpopadineti,closed,2025-05-05T18:00:42Z,2025-05-05T19:16:49Z,2025-05-05T19:16:49Z,,https://api.github.com/repos/antiwork/flexile,https://github.com/antiwork/flexile/pull/263,human,,https://github.com/antiwork/flexile,,antiwork/flexile,Ruby,361.0,765.0
2520323493,298,Remove pull_request_target from CI to fix rspec issues,"In #87, we changed the CI scripts' trigger from `push` to `pull_request_target` in order to more easily be able to run external contributors' workflows with our secrets. Unfortunately, GitHub does not provide a good solution for this, and the one we ended up using has been causing lots of issues with Rspec (like [this one](https://github.com/antiwork/flexile/actions/runs/15008154337/job/42171663206), where it tries to use the config and list of tests from `main` on the feature branch).

Thus, as a short-term solution, this PR removes the `pull_request_target` trigger. This will mean OSS contributors have to set up the secrets (that they also need locally to run the app) in their forks for CI to be able to run on their PRs. Alternatively, we can test them locally as needed. Either way, once secrets are no longer required to run tests, this will be the best and simplest solution.

### Release Notes

<details>
<summary>pnpm/pnpm (pnpm)</summary>

### [`v10.6.4`](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/releases/tag/v10.6.4): pnpm 10.6.4

[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/compare/v10.6.3...v10.6.4)

#### Patch Changes

-   Fix `pnpm dlx` with `--allow-build` flag [#&#8203;9263](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9263).
-   Invalid Node.js version in `use-node-version` should not cause pnpm itself to break [#&#8203;9276](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9276).
-   The max amount of workers running for linking packages from the store has been reduced to 4 to achieve optimal results [#&#8203;9286](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9286). The workers are performing many file system operations, so increasing the number of CPUs doesn't help performance after some point.

Updates the `selectComboboxOption` helper in `e2e/helpers/index.ts` to use `.first()` when selecting a combobox option.

## Reason

The previous locator `page.getByRole(""option"", { name: option, exact: true })` could fail or lead to flaky tests if multiple options with the exact same text exist in a combobox. By adding `.first()`, we ensure that Playwright clicks the first matching option it finds, making the selection deterministic and the helper function more robust.",Human,1855287,raulpopadineti,closed,2025-04-25T16:23:48Z,2025-04-25T16:33:35Z,2025-04-25T16:33:35Z,,https://api.github.com/repos/antiwork/flexile,https://github.com/antiwork/flexile/pull/193,human,,https://github.com/antiwork/flexile,,antiwork/flexile,Ruby,361.0,765.0

[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/alexrudall/ruby-openai/compare/v7.4.0...v8.0.0)

##### Added

-   Add Responses endpoints - thanks to my excellent colleague [@&#8203;simonx1](https://redirect.github.com/simonx1) for your work on this!
-   Add docs for the Deepseek chat API.
-   Add Models#delete - thanks to [bennysghost](https://redirect.github.com/bennysghost).

##### Fixed

-   \[BREAKING] Try to JSON parse everything. If it fails, fall back gracefully to returning the raw response. Thank you to [@&#8203;gregszero](https://redirect.github.com/gregszero) and the many others who raised this issue.
-   \[BREAKING] An unknown file type will no longer prevent file upload, but instead raise a warning.
-   \[BREAKING] ruby-openai longer requires ""faraday/multipart"" for Faraday 1 users (Faraday 1 already includes it and it was causing a warning). Thanks to [ajGingrich](https://redirect.github.com/ajGingrich) for raising this!
-   Add `user_data` and `evals` as options for known File types - thank you to [jontec](https://redirect.github.com/jontec) for this fix!
-   Fix a syntax ambiguity in Client.rb - thank you to [viralpraxis](https://redirect.github.com/viralpraxis).

##### Removed

-   \[BREAKING] Backwards compatibility for `require ""ruby/openai""` is removed - from v8 on you MUST use `require ""openai""`. This fixes a deprecation warning with Ruby 3.4. Thanks to [@&#8203;ndemianc](https://redirect.github.com/ndemianc) for this PR.
-   \[BREAKING] Removed support for Ruby 2.6. ruby-openai may still work with this version but it's no longer supported.

2447357573,91,Refactor document signing mechanism to be independent of legal names,"## Refactor Document Signing for Flexibility and Fix Legal Name Dependency

This pull request addresses a bug where document signing (e.g., consulting agreements) would fail if any signing party did not have a legal name set in their profile. It also refactors the underlying document signature mechanism to be more flexible and robustly support multiple signatories.

### Key Changes:

#### Introduce `document_signatures` Join Table:
- Created a new join table, `document_signatures`, to link documents and users.
- Replaces the previous approach of storing signatures directly on the document model (e.g., `contractor_signature`, `administrator_signature`).
- Each record in `document_signatures` represents a required signatory for a document.
  - Migration: `apps/rails/db/migrate/20250409021342_create_new_document_signatures.rb`

#### Update Document Model:
- Removed reliance on specific fields like `contractor_signature` and `administrator_signature`.
- Updated validation logic (`fully_signed`) to use the count of associated records in the `document_signatures` table to determine if a document is fully signed.
  - Model changes: `apps/rails/app/models/document.rb`
- **TODO/Potential Follow-up**: Remove legacy columns (`contractor_signature`, `administrator_signature`, `company_administrator_id`, `company_contractor_id`, `completed_at`) and potentially add `signed_at` to the `document_signatures` table for cleaner implementation.

#### Update Factories and Frontend:
- Adjusted document factories to support the new `document_signatures` association.
- Updated frontend TypeScript code handling document signatures to align with backend changes.

### Fixes:
- Resolves the issue where missing legal names blocked document signing.
- Makes the signing process independent of user profile details like legal names.
- Provides a scalable structure for documents with varying numbers of signatories.",Human,1855287,raulpopadineti,closed,2025-04-09T03:07:33Z,2025-04-14T18:53:38Z,2025-04-14T18:53:38Z,,https://api.github.com/repos/antiwork/flexile,https://github.com/antiwork/flexile/pull/91,human,,https://github.com/antiwork/flexile,,antiwork/flexile,Ruby,361.0,765.0

<summary>pnpm/pnpm (pnpm)</summary>

### [`v10.8.0`](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/blob/HEAD/pnpm/CHANGELOG.md#1080)

[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/compare/v10.7.1...v10.8.0)

##### Minor Changes

-   **Experimental.** A new hook is supported for updating configuration settings. The hook can be provided via `.pnpmfile.cjs`. For example:

    ```js
    module.exports = {
      hooks: {
        updateConfig: (config) => ({
          ...config,
          nodeLinker: ""hoisted"",
        }),
      },
    };
    ```
-   Now you can use the `pnpm add` command with the `--config` flag to install new configurational dependencies [#&#8203;9377](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/9377).

##### Patch Changes

-   Do not hang indefinitely, when there is a glob that starts with `!/` in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`. This fixes a regression introduced by [#&#8203;9169](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/9169).
-   `pnpm audit --fix` should update the overrides in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`.
-   `pnpm link` should update overrides in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, not in `package.json` [#&#8203;9365](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/9365).

2611345174,402,Fix desktop layout in CardContent on invoices page,"# Fix desktop layout in CardContent on invoices page

This PR fixes the desktop layout issue in the `CardContent` component on the `/invoices` page where form fields were stacking vertically instead of displaying in the intended two-column layout.

## Changes Made

- Changed grid layout from `lg:grid-cols-[1fr_auto_1fr]` to `lg:grid-cols-2` for consistent two-column desktop layout
- Moved equity compensation field into the left column alongside other form fields (Rate, Hours/Qty, Invoice date)
- Removed separators that were designed for the problematic three-column layout
- Ensures layout works consistently whether equity compensation is enabled or disabled

## Problem Solved

The original three-column grid layout (`lg:grid-cols-[1fr_auto_1fr]`) was breaking when the equity compensation section was conditionally rendered. When equity compensation was disabled, there were only two elements in a three-column grid, causing improper alignment and vertical stacking instead of the intended horizontal layout.

## Testing

- ✅ Lint checks passed with no ESLint warnings or errors
- ⚠️ Local testing was limited due to Redis connection issues in the development environment
- Layout changes are straightforward CSS grid modifications that should work as expected

## Screenshots

Before: Form fields stacked vertically

  - Adjusted CI workflows, process files, and ignore files to align with the new directory layout.
  - Removed obsolete environment files from old directories and added replacements where needed.
  - Updated documentation and setup instructions to reflect these structural changes.

### [`v8.0.2`](https://redirect.github.com/rails/rails/releases/tag/v8.0.2): 8.0.2

[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/rails/rails/compare/v8.0.1...v8.0.2)

#### Active Support

-   Fix setting `to_time_preserves_timezone` from `new_framework_defaults_8_0.rb`.

    *fatkodima*

-   Fix Active Support Cache `fetch_multi` when local store is active.

    `fetch_multi` now properly yield to the provided block for missing entries
    that have been recorded as such in the local store.

    *Jean Boussier*

-   Fix execution wrapping to report all exceptions, including `Exception`.

    If a more serious error like `SystemStackError` or `NoMemoryError` happens,
    the error reporter should be able to report these kinds of exceptions.

    *Gannon McGibbon*

-   Fix `RedisCacheStore` and `MemCacheStore` to also handle connection pool related errors.

    These errors are rescued and reported to `Rails.error`.

    *Jean Boussier*

-   Fix `ActiveSupport::Cache#read_multi` to respect version expiry when using local cache.

    *zzak*

-   Fix `ActiveSupport::MessageVerifier` and `ActiveSupport::MessageEncryptor` configuration of `on_rotation` callback.

    ```ruby
    verifier.rotate(old_secret).on_rotation { ... }
    ```

    Now both work as documented.

    *Jean Boussier*

-   Fix `ActiveSupport::MessageVerifier` to always be able to verify both URL-safe and URL-unsafe payloads.

    This is to allow transitioning seemlessly from either configuration without immediately invalidating
    all previously generated signed messages.

    *Jean Boussier*, *Florent Beaurain*, *Ali Sepehri*

-   Fix `cache.fetch` to honor the provided expiry when `:race_condition_ttl` is used.

    ```ruby
    cache.fetch(""key"", expires_in: 1.hour, race_condition_ttl: 5.second) do
      ""something""
    end
    ```

    In the above example, the final cache entry would have a 10 seconds TTL instead
    of the requested 1 hour.

    *Dhia*

-   Better handle procs with splat arguments in `set_callback`.

    *Radamés Roriz*

-   Fix `String#mb_chars` to not mutate the receiver.

    Previously it would call `force_encoding` on the receiver,
    now it dups the receiver first.

    *Jean Boussier*

-   Improve `ErrorSubscriber` to also mark error causes as reported.

    This avoid some cases of errors being reported twice, notably in views because of how
    errors are wrapped in `ActionView::Template::Error`.

    *Jean Boussier*

-   Fix `Module#module_parent_name` to return the correct name after the module has been named.

    When called on an anonymous module, the return value wouldn't change after the module was given a name
    later by being assigned to a constant.

    ```ruby
    mod = Module.new
    mod.module_parent_name # => ""Object""
    MyModule::Something = mod
    mod.module_parent_name # => ""MyModule""
    ```

    *Jean Boussier*

#### Active Model

-   No changes.

#### Active Record

-   Fix inverting `rename_enum_value` when `:from`/`:to` are provided.

    *fatkodima*

-   Prevent persisting invalid record.

    *Edouard Chin*

-   Fix inverting `drop_table` without options.

    *fatkodima*

-   Fix count with group by qualified name on loaded relation.

    *Ryuta Kamizono*

-   Fix `sum` with qualified name on loaded relation.

    *Chris Gunther*

-   The SQLite3 adapter quotes non-finite Numeric values like ""Infinity"" and ""NaN"".

    *Mike Dalessio*

-   Handle libpq returning a database version of 0 on no/bad connection in `PostgreSQLAdapter`.

    Before, this version would be cached and an error would be raised during connection configuration when
    comparing it with the minimum required version for the adapter. This meant that the connection could
    never be successfully configured on subsequent reconnection attempts.

    Now, this is treated as a connection failure consistent with libpq, raising a `ActiveRecord::ConnectionFailed`
    and ensuring the version isn't cached, which allows the version to be retrieved on the next connection attempt.

    *Joshua Young*, *Rian McGuire*

-   Fix error handling during connection configuration.

    Active Record wasn't properly handling errors during the connection configuration phase.
    This could lead to a partially configured connection being used, resulting in various exceptions,
    the most common being with the PostgreSQLAdapter raising ` undefined method  `key?' for nil`or`TypeError: wrong argument type nil (expected PG::TypeMap)\`.

    *Jean Boussier*

-   Fix a case where a non-retryable query could be marked retryable.

    *Hartley McGuire*

-   Handle circular references when autosaving associations.

    *zzak*

-   PoolConfig no longer keeps a reference to the connection class.

    Keeping a reference to the class caused subtle issues when combined with reloading in
    development. Fixes [#&#8203;54343](https://redirect.github.com/rails/rails/issues/54343).

    *Mike Dalessio*

-   Fix SQL notifications sometimes not sent when using async queries.

    ```ruby
    Post.async_count
    ActiveSupport::Notifications.subscribed(->(*) { ""Will never reach here"" }) do
      Post.count
    end
    ```

    In rare circumstances and under the right race condition, Active Support notifications
    would no longer be dispatched after using an asynchronous query.
    This is now fixed.

    *Edouard Chin*

-   Fix support for PostgreSQL enum types with commas in their name.

    *Arthur Hess*

-   Fix inserts on MySQL with no RETURNING support for a table with multiple auto populated columns.

    *Nikita Vasilevsky*

-   Fix joining on a scoped association with string joins and bind parameters.

    ```ruby
    class Instructor < ActiveRecord::Base
      has_many :instructor_roles, -> { active }
    end

    class InstructorRole < ActiveRecord::Base
      scope :active, -> {
        joins(""JOIN students ON instructor_roles.student_id = students.id"")
        .where(students { status: 1 })
      }
    end

    Instructor.joins(:instructor_roles).first
    ```

    The above example would result in `ActiveRecord::StatementInvalid` because the
    `active` scope bind parameters would be lost.

    *Jean Boussier*

-   Fix a potential race condition with system tests and transactional fixtures.

    *Sjoerd Lagarde*

-   Fix autosave associations to no longer validated unmodified associated records.

    Active Record was incorrectly performing validation on associated record that
    weren't created nor modified as part of the transaction:

    ```ruby
    Post.create!(author: User.find(1)) # Fail if user is invalid
    ```

    *Jean Boussier*

-   Remember when a database connection has recently been verified (for
    two seconds, by default), to avoid repeated reverifications during a
    single request.

    This should recreate a similar rate of verification as in Rails 7.1,
    where connections are leased for the duration of a request, and thus
    only verified once.

    *Matthew Draper*

#### Action View

-   Respect `html_options[:form]` when `collection_checkboxes` generates the
    hidden `<input>`.

    *Riccardo Odone*

-   Layouts have access to local variables passed to `render`.

    This fixes [#&#8203;31680](https://redirect.github.com/rails/rails/issues/31680) which was a regression in Rails 5.1.

    *Mike Dalessio*

-   Argument errors related to strict locals in templates now raise an
    `ActionView::StrictLocalsError`, and all other argument errors are reraised as-is.

    Previously, any `ArgumentError` raised during template rendering was swallowed during strict
    local error handling, so that an `ArgumentError` unrelated to strict locals (e.g., a helper
    method invoked with incorrect arguments) would be replaced by a similar `ArgumentError` with an
    unrelated backtrace, making it difficult to debug templates.

    Now, any `ArgumentError` unrelated to strict locals is reraised, preserving the original
    backtrace for developers.

    Also note that `ActionView::StrictLocalsError` is a subclass of `ArgumentError`, so any existing
    code that rescues `ArgumentError` will continue to work.

    Fixes [#&#8203;52227](https://redirect.github.com/rails/rails/issues/52227).

    *Mike Dalessio*

-   Fix stack overflow error in dependency tracker when dealing with circular dependencies

    *Jean Boussier*

#### Action Pack

-   Improve `with_routing` test helper to not rebuild the middleware stack.

    Otherwise some middleware configuration could be lost.

    *Édouard Chin*

-   Add resource name to the `ArgumentError` that's raised when invalid `:only` or `:except` options are given to `#resource` or `#resources`

    This makes it easier to locate the source of the problem, especially for routes drawn by gems.

    Before:

        :only and :except must include only [:index, :create, :new, :show, :update, :destroy, :edit], but also included [:foo, :bar]

    After:

        Route `resources :products` - :only and :except must include only [:index, :create, :new, :show, :update, :destroy, :edit], but also included [:foo, :bar]

    *Jeremy Green*

-   Fix `url_for` to handle `:path_params` gracefully when it's not a `Hash`.

    Prevents various security scanners from causing exceptions.

    *Martin Emde*

-   Fix `ActionDispatch::Executor` to unwrap exceptions like other error reporting middlewares.

    *Jean Boussier*

#### Active Job

-   No changes.

#### Action Mailer

-   No changes.

#### Action Cable

-   No changes.

#### Active Storage

-   A Blob will no longer autosave associated Attachment.

    This fixes an issue where a record with an attachment would have
    its dirty attributes reset, preventing your `after commit` callbacks
    on that record to behave as expected.

    Note that this change doesn't require any changes on your application
    and is supposed to be internal. Active Storage Attachment will continue
    to be autosaved (through a different relation).

    *Edouard-chin*

#### Action Mailbox

-   No changes.

#### Action Text

-   No changes.

#### Railties

-   Fix Rails console to load routes.

    Otherwise `*_path` and `*url` methods are missing on the `app` object.

    *Édouard Chin*

-   Update `rails new --minimal` option

    Extend the `--minimal` flag to exclude recently added features:
    `skip_brakeman`, `skip_ci`, `skip_docker`, `skip_kamal`, `skip_rubocop`, `skip_solid` and `skip_thruster`.

    *eelcoj*

-   Use `secret_key_base` from ENV or credentials when present locally.

    When ENV\[""SECRET_KEY_BASE""] or
    `Rails.application.credentials.secret_key_base` is set for test or
    development, it is used for the `Rails.config.secret_key_base`,

<summary>sidekiq/sidekiq (sidekiq)</summary>

### [`v8.0.1`](https://redirect.github.com/sidekiq/sidekiq/blob/HEAD/Changes.md#801)

[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/sidekiq/sidekiq/compare/v8.0.0...v8.0.1)

-   Relax Redis requirement to 7.0 for compatibility with AWS and Ubuntu 24.04 LTS. \[[#&#8203;6630](https://redirect.github.com/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/6630)]

### [`v8.0.0`](https://redirect.github.com/sidekiq/sidekiq/blob/HEAD/Changes.md#800)

[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/sidekiq/sidekiq/compare/v7.3.9...v8.0.0)

-   **WARNING** The underlying class name for Active Jobs has changed from `ActiveJob::QueueAdapters::SidekiqAdapter::JobWrapper` to `Sidekiq::ActiveJob::Wrapper`.
    The old name will still work in 8.x.
-   **WARNING** The `created_at`, `enqueued_at`, `failed_at` and `retried_at` attributes are now stored as epoch milliseconds, rather than epoch floats.
    This is meant to avoid precision issues with JSON and JavaScript's 53-bit Floats.
    Example: `""created_at"" => 1234567890.123456` -> `""created_at"" => 1234567890123`.
-   **NEW FEATURE** Job Profiling is now supported with [Vernier](https://vernier.prof)
    which makes it really easy to performance tune your slow jobs.
    The Web UI contains a new **Profiles** tab to view any collected profile data.
    Please read the new [Profiling](https://redirect.github.com/sidekiq/sidekiq/wiki/Profiling) wiki page for details.
-   **NEW FEATURE** Job Metrics now store up to 72 hours of data and the Web UI allows display of 24/48/72 hours. \[[#&#8203;6614](https://redirect.github.com/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/6614)]
-   CurrentAttribute support now uses `ActiveJob::Arguments` to serialize the context object, supporting Symbols and GlobalID.
    The change should be backwards compatible. \[[#&#8203;6510](https://redirect.github.com/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/6510)]
-   Freshen up `Sidekiq::Web` to simplify the code and improve security \[[#&#8203;6532](https://redirect.github.com/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/6532)]
    The CSS has been rewritten from scratch to remove the Bootstrap framework.
-   Add `on_cancel` callback for iterable jobs \[[#&#8203;6607](https://redirect.github.com/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/6607)]
-   Add `cursor` reader to get the current cursor inside iterable jobs \[[#&#8203;6606](https://redirect.github.com/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/6606)]
-   Default error logging has been modified to use Ruby's `Exception#detailed_message` and `#full_message` APIs.
-   CI now runs against Redis, Dragonfly and Valkey.
-   Job tags now allow custom CSS display \[[#&#8203;6595](https://redirect.github.com/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/6595)]
-   The Web UI's language picker now shows options in the native language
-   Remove global variable usage within the codebase
-   Colorize and adjust logging for easier reading
-   Adjust Sidekiq's default thread priority to -1 for a 50ms timeslice.
    This can help avoid TimeoutErrors when Sidekiq is overloaded. \[[#&#8203;6543](https://redirect.github.com/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/6543)]
-   Use `Logger#with_level`, remove Sidekiq's custom impl
-   Remove `base64` gem dependency
-   Support: (Dragonfly 1.27+, Valkey 7.2+, Redis 7.2+), Ruby 3.2+, Rails 7.0+

### GitHub Vulnerability Alerts

#### [CVE-2025-29927](https://redirect.github.com/vercel/next.js/security/advisories/GHSA-f82v-jwr5-mffw)

# Impact
It is possible to bypass authorization checks within a Next.js application, if the authorization check occurs in middleware.

# Patches
* For Next.js 15.x, this issue is fixed in `15.2.3`
* For Next.js 14.x, this issue is fixed in `14.2.25`
* For Next.js 13.x, this issue is fixed in `13.5.9`
* For Next.js 12.x, this issue is fixed in `12.3.5`
* For Next.js 11.x, consult the below workaround.

_Note: Next.js deployments hosted on Vercel are automatically protected against this vulnerability._

# Workaround
If patching to a safe version is infeasible, it is recommend that you prevent external user requests which contain the `x-middleware-subrequest` header from reaching your Next.js application.

I was running `pnpm playwright test` and cancelled midway. There were still dangling processes in the background which prevented me from running `bin/dev`. The only option was to restart my computer.

2612531872,403,Remove company details step from administrator onboarding,"# Remove company details step from administrator onboarding

## Summary
Removed the ""Set up your company"" step from the administrator onboarding flow as requested. The company details form fields (legal name, street address, city, state, ZIP code) are now collected in the administrator settings details page instead.

## Changes Made
- ✅ Removed ""Company details"" from the onboarding steps array in `frontend/app/companies/[companyId]/administrator/onboarding/index.ts`
- ✅ Deleted the entire company details onboarding page directory (`frontend/app/companies/[companyId]/administrator/onboarding/details/`)
- ✅ Updated administrator settings details page to include company address fields that were previously in onboarding
- ✅ Removed the e2e test file for the deleted onboarding step
- ✅ Updated form validation and field labels to match the original onboarding form

## Technical Details
- The onboarding flow now goes directly from ""Signup"" to ""Bank account"" (2 steps instead of 3)
- Company address fields are now collected via the TRPC `companies.update` mutation in settings
- The settings page already had the necessary backend support for these fields
- Maintained consistent form validation and user experience

## Testing
- [x] Code compiles without errors
- [x] Git history is clean with descriptive commit message
- [ ] Manual testing of onboarding flow (requires local dev environment)
- [ ] Manual testing of administrator settings page (requires local dev environment)

## Notes
This change consolidates company information collection into the settings page, making the onboarding flow more streamlined while ensuring all necessary data can still be collected and updated by administrators.

### Release Notes

<details>
<summary>pnpm/pnpm (pnpm)</summary>

### [`v10.7.0`](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/blob/HEAD/pnpm/CHANGELOG.md#1070)

[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/compare/v10.6.5...v10.7.0)

##### Minor Changes

-   `pnpm config get` and `list` also show settings set in `pnpm-workspace.yaml` files [#&#8203;9316](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/9316).

-   It should be possible to use env variables in `pnpm-workspace.yaml` setting names and value.

-   Add an ability to patch dependencies by version ranges. Exact versions override version ranges, which in turn override name-only patches. Version range `*` is the same as name-only, except that patch application failure will not be ignored.

    For example:

    ```yaml
    patchedDependencies:
      foo: patches/foo-1.patch
      foo@^2.0.0: patches/foo-2.patch
      foo@2.1.0: patches/foo-3.patch
    ```

    The above configuration would apply `patches/foo-3.patch` to `foo@2.1.0`, `patches/foo-2.patch` to all `foo` versions which satisfy `^2.0.0` except `2.1.0`, and `patches/foo-1.patch` to the remaining `foo` versions.

    > \[!WARNING]
    > The version ranges should not overlap. If you want to specialize a sub range, make sure to exclude it from the other keys. For example:
    >
    > ```yaml
    > # pnpm-workspace.yaml
    > patchedDependencies:
    >   # the specialized sub range
    >   'foo@2.2.0-2.8.0': patches/foo.2.2.0-2.8.0.patch
    >   # the more general patch, excluding the sub range above
    >   'foo@>=2.0.0 <2.2.0 || >2.8.0': 'patches/foo.gte2.patch
    > ```
    >
    > In most cases, however, it's sufficient to just define an exact version to override the range.

-   `pnpm config set --location=project` saves the setting to a `pnpm-workspace.yaml` file if no `.npmrc` file is present in the directory [#&#8203;9316](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/9316).

-   Rename `pnpm.allowNonAppliedPatches` to `pnpm.allowUnusedPatches`. The old name is still supported but it would print a deprecation warning message.

-   Add `pnpm.ignorePatchFailures` to manage whether pnpm would ignore patch application failures.

    If `ignorePatchFailures` is not set, pnpm would throw an error when patches with exact versions or version ranges fail to apply, and it would ignore failures from name-only patches.

    If `ignorePatchFailures` is explicitly set to `false`, pnpm would throw an error when any type of patch fails to apply.

    If `ignorePatchFailures` is explicitly set to `true`, pnpm would print a warning when any type of patch fails to apply.

##### Patch Changes

-   Remove dependency paths from audit output to prevent out-of-memory errors [#&#8203;9280](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9280).

##### ⚠️ Other Breaking changes in the SDK

-   [#&#8203;2277](https://redirect.github.com/stripe/stripe-node/pull/2277) Swap Stripe.webhooks from a factory function to a static property
    -   `Stripe.webhooks` and `Stripe().webhooks` are no longer functions (just plain objects)
        -   if you were already treating those properties as plain objects (per the types), then you can ignore this change
        -   if you were calling `Stripe.webhooks().someMethod()`, you should use `Stripe.webhooks.someMethod()` instead
        -   there shouldn't be user-facing functionality changing, just a slight breaking change in our internal organization
