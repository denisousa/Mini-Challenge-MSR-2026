If the user is not member of any project (closes team membership) the organization stats page can end up in two different states.

1. Default state for new users. none / all projects are selected

Both states are not ideal.
State 1 suggests on a first glance that there is no traffic in this organization and does not provide any valuable information.
But state 2 is problematic as requests fail and the page looks broken.

### Solution

Wrap the page in `<NoProjectMessage />` as we do for other pages that rely on project data.

### Checklist Before Starting

### What does this PR do?

### Motivation

In RL Ecosystem which use colocate design like [verl](https://github.com/volcengine/verl/tree/main), we need to offload training model and load serving model & KV Cache frequently.


#### Background
- Currently SGLang is using [torch_memory_saver](https://github.com/fzyzcjy/torch_memory_saver) to pause and resume.
- [torch_memory_saver](https://github.com/fzyzcjy/torch_memory_saver) is a open source repo that provided easy to use api to hack **cudaMalloc** and **cudaFree** to make sure the virtual address could be consistent after pause and resume, which is critical to ensure CUDA Graph work.
- CUDA Graph is critical to make sure SGLang runs faster in decoding phases.


#### Here is the current behavior of VERL + SGLang

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e87e7dd6-f223-4de6-8f07-915eb2030ea8)

1. During Training, we have training model and optimizer state in the GPU Memory, and once training is done, we will offload optimizer state to cpu and keep the model weights in GPU, which is needed in Update Weight.
2. During Update Weight, we awake the SGLang engine, so those paused memory of Model Weights and KV Cache will come back. Then we update model from training model to serving model on the fly using the api: `update_weights_in_tensor`
3. After Model being updated, we delete the training model from GPU Memory.


Above design works pretty well so far, however, this would waste a big chunk of GPU Memory during rollout, which could cause a few issues we've seen so far:
- **Small KV Cache**: We need to use relative lower number of mem fraction ratio (e.g: 0.6), hence our KV Cache has less tokens. Given KV Cache has less tokens, we will hit `RuntimeError: Prefill out of memory. Try to lower your batch size.` when we try prefill large number of requests.
- **Out of Memory**: If we use mem fraction ratio 0.8 and run RL for 32B model on 8 H100, it will OOM during update weight


#### Challenge
- `torch_memory_saver` currently only supports Singleton, hence SGLang will pause and resume KV Cache + Weights together, they are treated as the same group of memory controlled by the singleton `torch_memory_saver` instance

#### Proposal
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7fda9638-0dc2-4c14-bc64-cd20616f350f)

1. During Training, we do the same
2. During Update Weight Stage 1, we awake the model weights from SGLang and then update weights
3. During Update Weight Stage 2, we delete the training model weights from GPU Memory
4. Awake the SGLang's KV Cache


![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f3dab327-dc2e-4ed8-88d7-15e383f77d25)


### Benefit
With above feature, we can train larger model with same GPU, we can also make training/rollout more efficient given we can allocate larger KV Cache

### Solution: Keep using Singleton and provide tag based pause/resume

- [x] Support tag based resume/pause: https://github.com/fzyzcjy/torch_memory_saver/pull/20
- [x] Support Multiple Stage Awake in SGLang: https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/pull/7099

2608245390,1625,fix(deps): relax tenacity requirement to support google-genai 1.21.1,jxnl,4852235,closed,2025-06-20T19:06:01Z,2025-06-20T19:15:47Z,2025-06-20T19:15:47Z,https://api.github.com/repos/567-labs/instructor,https://github.com/567-labs/instructor/pull/1625,"## Summary
- Relaxed tenacity requirement from `>=9.0.0` to `>=8.2.3` to resolve dependency conflict
- Bumped version to 1.9.0
- Enables compatibility with latest google-genai (1.21.1)

## Problem
The latest versions of instructor (1.8.3) and google-genai (1.21.1) have conflicting tenacity requirements:
- google-genai 1.21.1 requires: `tenacity>=8.2.3,<9.0.0`
- instructor 1.8.3 requires: `tenacity>=9.0.0,<10.0.0`

These ranges are mutually exclusive, preventing users from installing both packages together.

## Solution
By relaxing instructor's tenacity requirement to `>=8.2.3,<10.0.0`, we allow both packages to coexist while maintaining compatibility with the functionality instructor needs from tenacity.

## Test plan
- [x] Verified installation works with `uv pip install ""instructor[google-genai]"" google-genai==1.21.1`
- [x] Ran linter and type checks
- [ ] Existing tests should pass with the relaxed dependency

Fixes #1641

2295215962,3314,Rework timestamp utilization for timezone consistency,stefannica,3963946,closed,2025-01-23T19:11:42Z,2025-01-24T16:47:26Z,2025-01-24T16:47:26Z,https://api.github.com/repos/zenml-io/zenml,https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/pull/3314,"## Describe changes
Following the previous PR (https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/pull/3265) that replaced deprecated `datetime.utcnow()` with `datetime.now(timezone.utc)`, some follow-up is required to ensure we use timezone-aware timestamps appropriately:

1. no timezone aware timestamps must be stored in the database. The convention is that the database stores only timezone-naive UTC timestamps 
2. comparisons and subtraction operations between timezone-aware and timezone-naive operands result in errors, so they must be avoided

This PR introduces a few time utils to make it easier to deal with timezones. It also goes through all occurrences of `datetime.now(timezone.utc)` and re-evaluates whether a timezone-aware timestamp is indeed needed and reverts some of the decisions in the previous PR if that's not the case.

This PR introduces tag-based filtering for FastMCP components (tools, resources, resource templates, and prompts), allowing servers to selectively expose functionality based on configurable include/exclude tag sets.

### Key Features
- **Include Tags**: Only components with matching tags are exposed
- **Exclude Tags**: Components with matching tags are filtered out  
- **Precedence**: Exclude tags take priority over include tags
- **Universal Support**: Works across all component types (tools, resources, templates, prompts)

### Usage
```python
# Only expose components tagged with ""public"" or ""api""
mcp = FastMCP(include_tags={""public"", ""api""})

# Hide components tagged as ""internal"" or ""deprecated"" 
mcp = FastMCP(exclude_tags={""internal"", ""deprecated""})

@mcp.tool(tags={""public"", ""utility""})
def my_tool(): ...
```

### Implementation
- Added `include_tags` and `exclude_tags` parameters to `FastMCP` constructor and `Settings`
- Implemented `_should_enable_component()` method with comprehensive filtering logic
- Updated all MCP protocol handlers to respect tag filters
- Added `tags` parameter to component decorators (`@tool`, `@resource`, `@prompt`)

This PR adds two new configuration options for agent steps (`^` prefixed steps) that enhance how CodingAgent (Claude Code) operates within Roast workflows.

### New Options:
1. **`continue: true`** - Maintains the Claude Code session across multiple agent steps, allowing for iterative development
2. **`include_context_summary: true`** - Provides an AI-generated summary of relevant workflow context to the agent

## Key Features

### Intelligent Context Summaries
- Created a new `ContextSummarizer` class that uses LLM to analyze workflow context
- Summaries are tailored to the agent's specific upcoming task
- Only relevant information is included, reducing token usage
- Returns ""No relevant information found in the workflow context."" when there's nothing relevant

### Session Continuation
- Adds `--continue` flag to Claude Code command when `continue: true` is set
- Enables iterative development workflows where agents build on previous work

## Implementation Details

- **Clean Architecture**: Separate `ContextSummarizer` class follows SOLID principles
- **Backward Compatible**: Both options default to `false`, so existing workflows continue unchanged
- **Well Tested**: Comprehensive test coverage for all new functionality
- **Documented**: Updated AGENT_STEPS.md and created example workflows

## Example Usage

```yaml
steps:
  - ^analyze_code
  - ^implement_fix
  - ^add_tests

implement_fix:
  continue: true  # Continue from where analyze_code left off

add_tests:
  include_context_summary: true  # Get AI-generated context about what was analyzed and fixed
  continue: true  # Also continue the session
```

## Testing

All tests pass. The implementation includes:
- Unit tests for ContextSummarizer
- Unit tests for CodingAgent option handling
- Integration tests showing the features in action
- Example workflows demonstrating usage

2553341049,460,fix: (eks-mcp-server) improve user agent versioning and clean up checkov skip annotations,srhsrhsrhsrh,43288700,closed,2025-05-29T22:21:58Z,2025-05-30T18:06:15Z,2025-05-30T18:06:15Z,https://api.github.com/repos/awslabs/mcp,https://github.com/awslabs/mcp/pull/460,"<!-- markdownlint-disable MD041 MD043 -->
Fixes

## Summary
Improve user agent versioning and clean up checkov skip annotations

### Changes
* Filter out checkov skips from templates used for generate in manage_eks_stacks and generate_app_manifest 
* Updated AWS client's user agent configuration to dynamically use the package version from __init__.py instead of hardcoding ""0.1.0""

### User experience

* The boto3 client used by the MCP server will have custom user agent with a dynamically set suffix 'awslabs/mcp/eks-mcp-server/{version}'.
* Checkov skip annotations will be filtered out from files generated by manage_eks_stacks and generate_app_manifest. They only exist to suppress checkov violations in the template files.

Fixes #23705 

<!-- If the PR belongs to a PIP, please add the PIP link here -->


<!-- Details of when a PIP is required and how the PIP process work, please see: https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/master/pip/README.md -->

### Motivation

See #23705 
In the realm of asynchronous processing, precise timing and performance metrics are essential for effective monitoring and optimization. Apache Pulsar Functions, as a distributed compute platform, relies heavily on asynchronous operations to process and transform data streams. However, the current implementation lacks a robust mechanism for accurately capturing and reporting the execution times of these asynchronous functions.


### Modifications
This Pull Request introduces several modifications to the Apache Pulsar Functions project aimed at improving the accuracy and reliability of asynchronous function execution time statistics. The primary goal is to enhance monitoring and analysis capabilities for function performance. Here’s a breakdown of the key changes:

1. Removal of processTimeStart Method: The processTimeStart method in ComponentStatsManager has been removed. This method was previously used to record the start time of asynchronous function execution. The start time is now recorded in the JavaExecutionResult object, providing a more centralized and consistent approach.

2. Modification of JavaInstanceRunnable: The run method in JavaInstanceRunnable has been updated to reflect the removal of processTimeStart. The stats.processTimeStart() call has been deleted, and the stats.processTimeEnd() method now accepts the start time as a parameter to calculate the total execution time.

3. Update to FunctionStatsManager: The processTimeEnd method in FunctionStatsManager has been modified to remove the processTimeStart member variable and accept the start time as a parameter. This allows for accurate calculation of the function’s execution time.

4. Changes to SinkStatsManager and SourceStatsManager: The processTimeEnd methods in SinkStatsManager and SourceStatsManager have been updated to accept the start time as a parameter. However, since these classes do not record processing time, the method bodies remain empty.

5. Addition of startTime in JavaExecutionResult: The JavaExecutionResult class now includes a startTime member variable to store the start time of asynchronous function execution. This allows for accurate calculation of execution time within the handleResult method of JavaInstanceRunnable.

6. Modification of AsyncFuncRequest: The AsyncFuncRequest class in JavaInstance now includes a result member variable of type JavaExecutionResult. This change ensures that the processAsyncResultsInInputOrder method uses the existing JavaExecutionResult object instead of creating a new one, maintaining consistency and avoiding duplication.

7. Use of Same ExecutionResult in Non-asyncPreserveInputOrder Mode: In scenarios where asyncPreserveInputOrderForOutputMessages is disabled, the same executionResult object is now used to avoid unnecessary object creation and potential issues with result assignment.

8. Fix for Result and Exception Handling: Two patches address potential bugs related to result and exception handling in JavaInstance. The processAsyncResultsInInputOrder method now ensures that the result and userException fields of JavaExecutionResult are properly set, improving the reliability of the execution result.

9. Addition of Test Case: A new test case, testAsyncFunctionTime, has been added to verify the accuracy of asynchronous function execution time recording and calculation. This test ensures that the start time recorded in JavaExecutionResult is within an acceptable range of the actual start time.

2556710275,40,fix: Map 'info' log type to Unity's 'Log' type for console log retrieval,Saqoosha,27694,closed,2025-05-31T12:57:20Z,2025-06-01T20:15:24Z,2025-06-01T20:15:24Z,https://api.github.com/repos/CoderGamester/mcp-unity,https://github.com/CoderGamester/mcp-unity/pull/40,"## Summary
• Fix info log type mapping issue in ConsoleLogsService where MCP's ""info"" parameter didn't match Unity's ""Log"" type
• Add mapping logic to convert ""info"" to ""Log"" before filtering log entries in GetAllLogsAsJson method

## Environment Details
- **Unity Version**: Unity 6 (6000.0.26f1) - tested and confirmed
- **Platform**: macOS 15.5 (Sequoia)
- **MCP Unity Version**: v1.1.0+
- **Affected Tool**: `get_console_logs` with `logType: ""info""` parameter

## Problem Description
The `get_console_logs` MCP tool was unable to retrieve info-level logs when using the `""info""` logType parameter. This occurred because:

1. **Unity Internal Logging**: `Debug.Log()` messages are stored as `LogType.Log` (string: `""Log""`)
2. **MCP Parameter**: Client requests use `logType: ""info""`
3. **Filtering Logic**: Direct string comparison `""info"" \!= ""Log""` caused info logs to be filtered out

### Reproduction Steps
```typescript
// This would return empty array before the fix
get_console_logs({ logType: ""info"" })
```

## Root Cause
In `ConsoleLogsService.cs` line 83, the filtering logic:
```csharp
if (filter && \!entry.Type.ToString().Equals(logType, System.StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase))
```
Would compare `""info""` (MCP parameter) with `""Log""` (Unity's LogType.Log.ToString()), causing a mismatch.

## Solution
Added type mapping logic before filtering:
```csharp
// Map MCP log types to Unity log types
string unityLogType = logType;
if (logType.Equals(""info"", System.StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase))
    unityLogType = ""Log"";
```

## Test Plan
- [x] Send info log via `send_console_log` tool with `type: ""info""`
- [x] Retrieve info logs via `get_console_logs` tool with `logType: ""info""`
- [x] Verify warning and error logs still work correctly

## Description

Some SQL query strings are built using potentially unsafe string concatenation rather than parameter binding.

In \Mautic\CampaignBundle\Entity\LeadEventLogRepository::getChartQuery(), several query conditions are built using direct string concatenation and manual quoting, both of which are potentially unsafe. For example:



$query->andwhere(""e.channel = '"".$options['channel'].""'"");
This has the potential for problems if the value in $options['channel'] contains single quotes or other metacharacters. It is difficult to work backwards reliably from such a condition string to form a query constraint; It's much safer to give Doctrine the parameter separately, allowing it to escape, quote, and bind the value safely, so this would become:



$query->andWhere('e.channel = :channel')
  ->setParameter('channel', $options['channel']) |
This pattern appears in several other places.

We did not investigate whether it's possible to exploit this, and these specific cases may be sanitised or made safe somewhere upstream of this method call, but this string concatenation approach is something that should be avoided in general.

Impact

Some submitted values could open the way to SQL injection or unexpected errors.

This PR:
- Fixes the ability to edit a title from the chat and chat nav pages
- Adds autofocus to the text field so it's immediately selected. This resolves the weird UX where you select 'edit title' but then don't edit the title. Clicking around doesn't cancel the action currently - with `autofocus: true` it does

2547361344,798,Trim obsolete test and polish Javadoc for core top level package,peter-lawrey,1070321,closed,2025-05-27T19:04:10Z,2025-06-03T13:59:03Z,2025-06-03T13:59:03Z,https://api.github.com/repos/OpenHFT/Chronicle-Core,https://github.com/OpenHFT/Chronicle-Core/pull/798,"## Why this matters
* The deleted test duplicated coverage already provided by `ChronicleInitTest`
* `core` lacked a package-level description explaining its off-heap memory model.  
* Recent Javadoc linting raised 42 warnings on Chronicle **master** (mis-tagged params, HTML `<` char, missing summary lines). These break `mvn -javadoc:aggregate` when `-Werror` is enabled.

## What is in here
| Change-set | Area | Notes |
|------------|------|-------|
| **984f5bc** | **tests** | Remove `ChronicleInitRunnableTest` (now redundant). |
| **67deefb** | docs | Add `package-info.java`; drop stale `@since` tag. |
| **d9daefa** | docs | Rewrite method JavaDocs in `Jvm`, `Maths`, `Memory`, `OS`, `Histogram`. *All first sentences now fit 120 chars and use imperative mood.* |
| **b1ecaf0** | docs | Escape “≤” as `&lt;=` to silence Javadoc HTML5 parser. |
| **4bd3fac** | docs | Minor wording tweaks in `StackTrace` and second pass over `Histogram`. |

## Impact
* **Functionality:** none – code paths unchanged.  
* **Docs:** Javadoc generation is warning-free (`mvn -q javadoc:test-javadoc`).  
* **Build time:** –4 s on GitHub Actions (Linux x64, Temurin 21).

|------|--------|
| **Tests** | *Removed* locally-defined `assertBetween()` from `PosixTimeProviderTest`; we now reuse the shared helper from `SystemTimeProviderTest`. |
| **API docs** | *New* `package-info.java` gives a browsable overview + comparison table of all time providers. |
|  | `TimeProvider` Javadoc explains wall-clock regression and points to a monotonic wrapper. |
|  | `SystemTimeProvider` docs now include a delta-algorithm diagram & updated **40 ns** latency figure. |
|  | Added / clarified Javadoc on `PosixTimeProvider`, `SetTimeProvider`, `UniqueMicroTimeProvider`, and every public method of `LongTime`. |
| **Algorithm docs** | *New* AsciiDoc `unique-micro-time-provider-cas-loop.adoc` containing: <br>• mermaid CAS-loop diagram<br>• step-by-step walk-through<br>• formal guarantees, perf numbers, pitfalls & usage snippets. |
| **Doc build** | Dropped problematic `@implSpec/@implNote` tags that broke Javadoc 8; added `:source-highlighter: rouge` for AsciiDoctor. |
| **House-keeping** | Updated copyright headers & fixed typos. |

---

### 📖 Why  

* **Discoverability** – The time package had no package-level docs and only sparse class comments.  
* **Accuracy** – Latency numbers and algorithm descriptions had drifted since 2021.  
* **Single-source diagrams** – new `.adoc` page renders on GitHub *and* in the manual.

No production logic, bytecode, or behavioural flow is touched.

---

## ✨ Why merge this?

* **Smaller surface** – 65 lines of redundant comments + an unused `TimerTest` (mock-only, no assertions) have been deleted.
* **Self-documenting API** – every timer, event-loop and thread-clean-up class now carries IDE-friendly Javadoc with:
  * clear parameter / contract statements
  * `@apiNote`, `@implSpec`, and `@implNote` where relevant
  * runnable code snippets illustrating best practice
* **Consistent guidelines** – `package-info.java` for *threads* and *scoped* packages now read the same, reference null-contract and alias rules.
* **Example driven** – quick-start snippets added to `CancellableTimer`, `Timer`, `Hooklet`, `InvalidEventHandlerException`, etc.
* **Accidental leak prevention** – docs explain weak-reference helpers and `CleaningThreadLocal`, including caveats and memory-leak scenarios.
* **Test hygiene** – JUnit 5 assertions replace vintage JUnit 4 calls in a few tests.

This PR is a documentation-focused sweep that tightens wording, clarifies contracts, and removes small glitches discovered while working on #762-#772. **No production logic is changed.**

## ✨ Highlights

| Area | Change | Why it matters |
|------|--------|----------------|
| **General clean-ups** | • Fixed typos (“an unique” → “a unique”).<br>• Updated JUnit 4 imports to JUnit 5 in tests.<br>• Removed a redundant cast in `PriorityHookTest`. | Keeps CI warnings at zero and aligns with the rest of the test-suite. |
| **`scoped` package** | • Added full class-level headers to `AbstractScopedResource`, `ScopedResource`, `ScopedThreadLocal`, `Strong/WeakReferenceScopedResource`.<br>• Introduced `package-info.java` with a runnable example and thread-confinement rules.<br>• Expanded constructor/parameter docs and clarified weak vs strong semantics. | Developers can now rely on IDE quick-docs rather than reading source. |
| **`shutdown` package** | • Re-wrote Javadoc for `Hooklet` & `PriorityHook`, detailing priority ranges, identity semantics, and thread-safety.<br>• Added null-checks in factory helper and in docs. | Makes the shutdown subsystem self-explaining and harder to misuse in multi-module deployments. |
| **`pom` helper** | • Added class header to `PomProperties` and annotated parameters as non-null. | Completes public API documentation coverage. |
| **Tests** | • Minor import / assertion updates to use `org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions`. | Moves more tests to JUnit 5 baseline. |

This PR is a purely **non-functional** update that tightens up our public contract, clears dead code, and improves IDE discoverability across the *pool* and *test* modules. Four logical commits are included for easier review.

## ✨ What’s new

| Title | Summary of changes |
| ----- | ------------------ |
| *remove commented placeholder for additional tests in `ClassLookupTest`* | • Deletes a stale “// Additional tests…” stub to keep the test class noise-free. |
| *Add Javadoc examples for enum interners* | • Adds runnable code snippets to `DynamicEnumClass` and `EnumInterner`.<br>• Minor formatting fixes around multi-line `<pre>{@code …}` blocks. |
| *Revert package-level defaults outside pool* | • Restores explicit `@Nullable` on methods that can return `null`.<br>• Extends/clarifies Javadoc in `EnumCache`, `ParsingCache`, `StringInterner`, `StaticEnumClass`, and adds richer `package-info.java` narrative.<br>• Provides missing return-value docs, improves parameter wording, fixes typos. |
| *Remove since tags from pool classes* | • Drops out-of-date `@since` tags that clutter docs.<br>• Adds top-level comments and fine-grained docs to `ClassAliasPool`, `DynamicEnumClass`, `StaticEnumClass`, `StringBuilderPool`, `StringInterner`. |

## 🛠️ Implementation notes

* Annotation footprint kept minimal—only genuinely nullable paths were marked.  
* **No byte-code or logic changes**; CI should pass unchanged.  
* Documentation compiled locally with `mvn javadoc:javadoc -P release` (no warnings).

It finishes the work started in #751-#759, then removes a few items that review feedback flagged as noise.

|-------|-------|-------|
| 01/13 | **Whitespace** | Strip stray blanks from `package-info.java` to stop AsciiDoc paragraph drift. |
| 02-10/13 | **Javadoc overhaul** | Add or rewrite comments for every public type:<br>• crisp first-sentence summaries<br>• full `@param/@return/@throws` sets<br>• explicit thread-safety statements<br>• SLF4J mapping table in `LogLevel`<br>• examples and `@implNote/@apiNote`s<br>• modernised package overview. |

| 13/13 | **Tag hygiene** | Drop the `@since 3.25ea` markers that were making the docs verbose |

### Why we need it
* **Cleaner generated docs** – IDE tool-tips and the public site no longer italicise parameter names or show duplicated text.  
* **Accurate contracts** – Users now see thread-safety guarantees and fallback behaviour explicitly called out.  
* **Maintenance** – The codebase no longer carries superfluous tags, so future contributors have less clutter to maintain.  

There are **no code-path or binary changes**; all unit tests still pass.

### Impact & migration
Zero runtime impact – consumers do **not** need to recompile or change any code. The only visible change is richer, cleaner documentation.

Additionally, several optimisations have been made to code consistency and performance monitoring, especially regarding reference counting and background resource management.

**Key Changes:**

1. **Suppression of Warnings for Busy Waits:**
   - Added `@SuppressWarnings(""BusyWait"")` to methods using busy-wait loops (`Thread.sleep(1)`) in classes like `AbstractCloseable`, `BackgroundResourceReleaser`, and `TracingReferenceCounted` to address IDE warnings.

2. **Improved Javadoc on Resource Lifecycle and Reference Counting:**
   - Enhanced the Javadoc for resource management and reference counting to provide more context about how resources are acquired, shared, and eventually released, with a focus on how `AbstractCloseableReferenceCounted` and related classes handle resource cleanup in a background thread.
   - Added lifecycle examples for `ReferenceCounted` to clarify how reference-counting operations (`reserve`, `release`, and `releaseLast`) work and how background releasing via `BackgroundResourceReleaser` is integrated.
   - Updated the description for `BackgroundResourceReleaser` to provide more explicit instructions on its use in managing resources asynchronously.

3. **Clarification of Threading and Validation Interfaces:**
   - Refined documentation for interfaces such as `SingleThreadedChecked` and `Validatable`, providing clearer examples of their usage and emphasising the importance of validation in the context of object serialisation.
   - Improved the explanation of the `Syncable` interface for synchronising data with backing stores.

4. **Exception Overview Documentation:**
   - Added a new section to the documentation outlining the key exceptions used in Chronicle-Core, such as `ClosedIllegalStateException`, `ClosedIORuntimeException`, and `ThreadingIllegalStateException`. Each exception is explained with a typical usage example.

5. **Refinement of `ReferenceCounted` Lifecycle Javadoc:**
   - Updated the Javadoc for `ReferenceCounted` and related classes to provide a more detailed overview of their lifecycle, including the handling of reference counting and clean-up in both foreground and background contexts.
   - Removed redundant sections to streamline the explanation of reference counting methods.

6. **Miscellaneous Code Cleanups:**
   - Refined error handling in `BackgroundResourceReleaserTest` for more consistent test results across environments.

**Additional Notes:**
- These updates aim to provide more precise and comprehensive documentation for developers using Chronicle-Core, particularly in understanding resource lifecycle management, reference counting, and threading models.
- The exception overview section adds a new reference for developers to quickly understand how to handle different runtime errors related to resource management.
- The changes also address IDE warnings and enhance the overall stability of resource handling, particularly in concurrent environments.

Together they **remove redundant test code** and **significantly enrich the Javadoc** for every annotation in `net.openhft.chronicle.core.annotation`, providing clear, consistent and tool-friendly documentation.

---

## Remove unused test

* **Deleted:** `ScopeConfinedTest.java` (49 lines)  
  *The test neither asserted library behaviour nor exercised production code. Removing it shrinks the test-suite surface and eliminates maintenance noise.*

---

## Improve annotation Javadoc (#739)

* **Added ~200 Javadoc lines, removed legacy boiler-plate.**
* **Key themes**
  * First-sentence definitions: **“`@X` indicates …`”** for instant context.
  * *Retention and effect* paragraphs clarifying compile-/run-time visibility.
  * Minimal usage snippets for every annotation.
  * Cross-links (`@see`) so related annotations discover each other.
  * British spelling with US technical keywords (`synchronized`, etc.).

---

## Enhance annotation Javadoc (#740)

* **Follow-up polish** driven by review feedback:
  * Extra examples, limitation notes and small API tables for the sign/range annotations.
  * Deeper rationale for `@DontChain`, `@ScopeConfined`, `@SingleThreaded`, `@UsedViaReflection`.
  * Extended package-level overview (lists every annotation, design goals, author & since tags).
  * Clarified `ChronicleFeature` semantics and `TargetMajorVersion` precedence.
  * Added IDE / ProGuard hints where reflection is involved.

It was observed that when 2 of these messages arrive in a row, rsyslogd crashes. This is clearly due to memory corruption, as the crash comes from within calloc.

Unlike the crash, valgrind only complained about the first message. It reported that the 'find' variable was being accessed in the replace function, reading past allocated data.

The localpattern variable ends up ""empty"" (null?), because the pattern fails to match. This ends up passed into the replace function as an es_str_t with a length and buffer length of 0. There is no string data, not even a null terminator.

As a result, the 'find' pointer is invalid, and accessing it is an error. Protect against accessing the 'find' pointer when the buffer is empty by exiting the two loops when j == lfind and lfind == 0.

This removes the report from valgrind, and stops rsyslogd from crashing.

- Corrected `README.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md` to accurately state that documentation is located in the `doc/` directory of this repository, not in a separate `rsyslog-doc` project.
- Added a placeholder file for the `omczmq` module documentation at `doc/source/configuration/modules/omczmq.rst`, as it was previously missing.
- Updated `doc/README.md` to recommend Python 3 and a modern Sphinx version for building documentation, removing outdated Python 2.7 references.
- Updated `doc/source/conf.py` to set `needs_sphinx = '4.5.0'` (from '1.5.1').
- Clarified the ""WildCards"" section in `doc/source/configuration/modules/imfile.rst` to better reflect current functionality regarding wildcard usage in paths and filenames.

These changes aim to improve the accuracy and maintainability of the project's documentation.

- https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx/blob/2c11d10/python/mlx/nn/layers/quantized.py#L138

Which ends up overwriting the `Gemma3nTextScaledWordEmbedding` instance with `QuantizedEmbedding`. This means that `Gemma3nTextScaledWordEmbedding.__call__` never gets called when the model is quantized.

Fix this issue by moving the scaling outside of `Gemma3nTextScaledWordEmbedding` and deleting `Gemma3nTextScaledWordEmbedding`.

## Summary

This PR enhances the string pooling mechanism in `Whisper.net` to optimize memory usage and reduce allocations when handling strings, particularly in high-performance scenarios. The changes focus on refining how strings are pooled, retrieved, and returned, ensuring efficient reuse.

## Changes

- Implemented `StringPool` to manage and reuse strings, reducing memory pressure.
- Optimized UTF8 string conversion using pooled strings to avoid unnecessary allocations.
- Introduced `ReturnString` to correctly reinsert strings into the pool for future reuse.
- Integrated `StringPool` usage across `WhisperProcessor` where applicable.
- Ensured thread safety and performance by structuring the pool using `SortedList<int, Stack<string>>`.
- Added example of how to use default string pool.

## Benefits

- **Lower GC Pressure**: Reduces the number of string allocations, minimizing garbage collection overhead.
- **Improved Performance**: Reuses pre-allocated strings where possible, speeding up frequent string operations.

## Notes

- This PR only modifies the string pooling logic; no other functional changes were made.
- The default behavior remains unchanged unless explicitly configured to use the string pool.

<p>We are working towards a simplified SSL configuration API.</p>

<li>The <code>cert</code> argument is now deprecated and will raise warnings.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our revised <a href=""https://github.com/encode/httpx/blob/HEAD/docs/advanced/ssl.md"">SSL documentation</a> covers how to implement the same behaviour with a more constrained API.</p>

<ul>
<li>The deprecated <code>proxies</code> argument has now been removed.</li>
<li>The deprecated <code>app</code> argument has now been removed.</li>

<h2>0.28.1 (6th December, 2024)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fix SSL case where <code>verify=False</code> together with client side certificates.</li>
</ul>
<h2>0.28.0 (28th November, 2024)</h2>
<p>Be aware that the default <em>JSON request bodies now use a more compact representation</em>. This is generally considered a prefered style, tho may require updates to test suites.</p>
<p>The 0.28 release includes a limited set of deprecations...</p>
<p><strong>Deprecations</strong>:</p>
<p>We are working towards a simplified SSL configuration API.</p>
<p><em>For users of the standard <code>verify=True</code> or <code>verify=False</code> cases, or <code>verify=&lt;ssl_context&gt;</code> case this should require no changes. The following cases have been deprecated...</em></p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>verify</code> argument as a string argument is now deprecated and will raise warnings.</li>
<li>The <code>cert</code> argument is now deprecated and will raise warnings.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our revised <a href=""https://github.com/encode/httpx/blob/master/docs/advanced/ssl.md"">SSL documentation</a> covers how to implement the same behaviour with a more constrained API.</p>
<p><strong>The following changes are also included</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The deprecated <code>proxies</code> argument has now been removed.</li>
<li>The deprecated <code>app</code> argument has now been removed.</li>
<li>JSON request bodies use a compact representation. (<a href=""https://redirect.github.com/encode/httpx/issues/3363"">#3363</a>)</li>
<li>Review URL percent escape sets, based on WHATWG spec. (<a href=""https://redirect.github.com/encode/httpx/issues/3371"">#3371</a>, <a href=""https://redirect.github.com/encode/httpx/issues/3373"">#3373</a>)</li>
<li>Ensure <code>certifi</code> and <code>httpcore</code> are only imported if required. (<a href=""https://redirect.github.com/encode/httpx/issues/3377"">#3377</a>)</li>
<li>Treat <code>socks5h</code> as a valid proxy scheme. (<a href=""https://redirect.github.com/encode/httpx/issues/3178"">#3178</a>)</li>
<li>Cleanup <code>Request()</code> method signature in line with <code>client.request()</code> and <code>httpx.request()</code>. (<a href=""https://redirect.github.com/encode/httpx/issues/3378"">#3378</a>)</li>

### Changes 🏗️

Fix these UI issues:
* (screenshot attached above) Key-value input width was unintentionally maxed out due to a stale CSS rule.
* When multiple executions within the same node are running, we pick the latest status, making one running and one completed execution displayed as completed.
* No balance errors were executed, only displayed while at least one node execution was triggered, while this can be done directly when the execution request is triggered.
* Run & Stop button glitch: it's still showing as stopped when the graph is still running, this is due to way the UI code tracks execution in the node-level, instead of graph level.

we’re currently using optional multi select, and it’s working great. We’re able to correctly determine the data type for it. However, there’s a small issue. We’re not using the correct subSchema that is inside anyOf on the multi select input. This is why we’re getting the problem on the Twitter block. It’s the only one that’s using this type of input, so it’s the only one that’s affected.

The latest Supabase changes hide the 5432 port from the supabase-db container and shift it to the supavisor, the instance that we are currently not using. This causes an error in the existing setup.

## BREAKING CHANGES

This change will introduce different volume locations for the database content, pulling this change will make the data content fresh from the start. To keep your old data with this change, execute this command:
```
cp -r supabase/docker/volumes/db/data db/docker/volumes/db/data
```


### Changes 🏗️

The scope of this PR is snapshotting the current docker-compose code obtained from the Supabase repository and embedding it into our repository. This will eliminate the need for submodule / recursive cloning and bringing the entire Supabase repository into the platform.

### 📙 Overview

- New Input component (`components/atoms/Input/`)
- Multiple input types with smart formatting:
  - `type=""text""` → Basic text input with no filtering
  - `type=""email""` → Email input (no character filtering)  
  - `type=""password""` → Password input with masking
  - `type=""number""` → Number input with character filtering (digits, decimal, minus)
  - `type=""amount""` → Formatted number input with comma separators and decimal limiting
  - `type=""tel""` → Phone input allowing only `+()[] ` and digits
  - `type=""url""` → URL input (no character filtering)

### 📙 Smart formatting features

- Amount type: `1000` → `1,000`, `1234.567` → `1,234.56` (with `decimalCount={2}`)
- Number type: `abc123def` → `123`, `12.34.56` → `12.3456`
- Phone type: `abc+1(555)def` → `+1(555)`

### 📙 Other

- Error state with `error` prop - shows red border and error message below input
- Label control with `hideLabel` prop for accessibility
- Decimal precision control via `decimalCount` prop (amount type only, default: 4)

### 📙 Architecture

- **Clean separation**: `Input.tsx` (render), `useInput.ts` (logic), `helpers.ts` (utilities)
- **Comprehensive Storybook stories** with usage examples and documentation

### 📙 Examples
```tsx
// Basic inputs
<Input type=""text"" label=""Full Name"" />
<Input type=""email"" label=""Email"" error=""Invalid email"" />

// Formatted inputs  
<Input type=""amount"" label=""Price"" decimalCount={2} />
<Input type=""tel"" label=""Phone"" placeholder=""+1 (555) 123-4567"" />

// Number input (unlimited decimals)
<Input type=""number"" label=""Score"" />
```

I think it's better to sort the history by clicked time. So the last clicked item is on top.

Hence, it required saving the time when the story is clicked by user.

Also the time shown on `meta_view` is not time from api response but using the time when the story is clicked.

The goal is to serve back simplified polygon

### 📄 100% (1.00x) speedup for ***`execute_gpt_4v_request` in `inference/core/workflows/core_steps/models/foundation/openai/v3.py`***

⏱️ Runtime :   **`107 milliseconds`**  **→** **`53.6 milliseconds`** (best of `5` runs)
### 📝 Explanation and details

Here is an optimized version of your program for runtime and memory. The majority of runtime is IO/network-bound (API requests) and not CPU-bound code, so the best possible single-process CPU optimization is to **avoid repeated work** (e.g., repeated endpoint string formatting or client allocation) and **simplify fast paths**. If you can batch or async requests, that would reduce end-to-end latency, but that changes function signatures and semantics so is out of scope. Here we focus on making your function as lean as possible within its expected use. 

**Key improvements:**
- **Reuse OpenAI client (`OpenAI`) where possible**: Creating the client is surprisingly expensive per your profiling.
- **Optimize prompt and payload building:** Avoid unnecessary field-level assignments.
- **Use exception chaining efficiently.**
- **Minimize calls to `.startswith()` by using a tuple form.**
- **Precompute endpoint format string if possible.**
- **Move non-error computations out of try/except.**



**Summary:**  
- OpenAI client creation is now cached, saving repeated cost.
- Efficient prefix checking for OpenAI key.
- Payloads & try/except blocks are trimmed for speed and clarity.
- Function signatures and return values are preserved.
- Comments are updated only where logic is improved or needs clarification.

If you control parallelism at a higher level, running requests in parallel (with `asyncio` or threading) would yield much higher throughput as both requests and OpenAI are IO bound.

This PR introduces a new HTTP client architecture for the AgentOps SDK and fixes related tests. The architecture follows a clean separation of concerns design principle, making the code more maintainable, testable, and extensible.

## New Architecture

### Components

#### HttpClient
- Provides low-level HTTP functionality with connection pooling and retry logic
- Manages session creation and reuse
- Offers both regular and authenticated sessions
- Implements basic HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)

#### AuthManager
- Handles authentication concerns including token acquisition, storage, and refresh
- Provides thread-safe token operations
- Prepares authentication headers for requests
- Detects expired tokens from API responses

#### HTTP Adapters
- **BaseHTTPAdapter**: Enhanced connection pooling and retry logic
- **AuthenticatedHttpAdapter**: Extends BaseHTTPAdapter with authentication capabilities, automatically refreshing tokens when needed

#### Exporters
- **AuthenticatedOTLPExporter**: OpenTelemetry exporter with authentication support

### Design Principles
1. **Separation of Concerns**: HTTP concerns are isolated from authentication concerns
2. **Composition over Inheritance**: Components use composition rather than inheritance
3. **Clear Interfaces**: Each component has a well-defined interface
4. **Dependency Flow**: Dependencies flow in one direction


## Benefits
1. **Improved Testability**: Each component can be tested in isolation
2. **Better Error Handling**: Clear separation of authentication and HTTP errors
3. **Enhanced Maintainability**: Single responsibility principle applied throughout
4. **Extensibility**: New authentication methods or HTTP features can be added without affecting existing code

**📘 Description**
While implementing mem0 instrumentation, discovered that multiple isolated traces were being created instead of proper parent-child span relationships within a session. This broke the trace hierarchy and made it difficult to understand the flow of operations.

Root Cause: mem0 (and potentially other LLM libraries) uses `ThreadPoolExecutor` for concurrent operations, but AgentOps lacked instrumentation for thread pool execution contexts. This caused trace context to be lost when operations moved to background threads, resulting in orphaned spans instead of a cohesive trace tree.

- Added a new module for instrumenting the concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor to ensure proper OpenTelemetry context propagation across threads.
- Introduced the ConcurrentFuturesInstrumentor class, which wraps the ThreadPoolExecutor's initialization and submission methods to maintain context.
- Enhanced the _should_instrument_package function to include utility instrumentors in the instrumentation decision process.
- Updated the TARGET_PACKAGES set to include utility instrumentors for comprehensive monitoring.
- Added unit tests to validate context propagation behavior in concurrent execution scenarios, ensuring spans share trace IDs correctly across threads.

These changes improve the observability and reliability of concurrent operations within the AgentOps SDK.

## Purpose

Fix `test_update_returns_state` in `test_simple_kalman.py` where the test was incorrectly comparing a 1D list to a 2D list.

The original test:
```python
  def update_returns_state(self):
    x = self.kf.update(100)
    assert x == self.kf.x
```
The test did not had the `test_` prefix so it was never called.
incorrectly assumed that `x` (a 1D list) and `self.kf.x` (a 2D list) were directly comparable.  
This change adds `test_update_returns_state` to the set of tests and explicitly flattens `self.kf.x` during the assertion:
```python
  def test_update_returns_state(self):
    x = self.kf.update(100)
   assert x == [i[0] for i in self.kf.x]
```
This ensures a proper value comparison and prevents false test failures.

---

## Justification

- **Verification**: After this change, the tests pass without modifying the Kalman filter's internal representation.
- **Purpose**: To fix the test structure without altering code functionality.
- **Impact**: Minimal; strictly testing fix, no effect on runtime behavior or functionality.

---

## Testing

- Ran `pytest test_simple_kalman.py`.
- Confirmed that the test is passing.
- No regressions observed.

---

## Additional Notes

- The change was applied **in two locations** where identical `test_update_returns_state` functions exist.
- No functionality was modified, only the test's assertion logic.

This PR adds unit tests (`<path to file>`) to enforce data schema conventions. The tests validate the following:

* Python object naming conventions:

  * Node classes end with `Schema`
  * Relationship classes end with `Rel`
  * Node properties classes end with `Properties`
  * Relationship properties classes end with `RelProperties`
* All `sub_resource_relationship`s must have the label `RESOURCE` and direction `INWARD`
* Each module must have **at least one** root node (i.e., a node with no `sub_resource_relationship`)
* Each module must have **at most one** root node

> ⚠️ During the data model migration phase, these tests will only emit warnings and are non-blocking.

### Notes

* While the naming conventions might seem like nitpicking, they greatly improve overall code consistency, readability, and make AI-assisted code completion much more relevant and effective.

* I also renamed all affected objects in this PR to align with the conventions. The only executable code added is the test itself.

## Summary by mrge
Added error handling for AWS launch templates that no longer exist during synchronization. This prevents process interruption when short-lived launch templates disappear between discovery and version fetching.

**Bug Fixes**
- Added try/except block to catch and handle missing launch template errors
- Added specific error handling for `InvalidLaunchTemplateId.NotFound` errors
- Added warning log when templates no longer exist instead of failing

### Summary

Added error handling to the function that fetches the launch template versions so that the process doesn't get interrumpted when we can't find the launch template anymore. 

Some setups will have very short lived launch templates that will cause this part to fail if the launch template previously fetched doesn't exist anymore. More details in the bug issue.

Workaround:
- add `data-op-ignore=""true""` field on `FormElement` text input to prevent 1password from overlaying its buttons on top of form fields contained in modals that are present in the DOM but not visible.

A cleaner fix would be to remove the `dialog` from the DOM when not shown, but this workaround should be sufficient for now.

This PR fixes:
- bug: a task with structured input will have its schema ASCII-escaped in the sample input generation task (due to `list_json_schema_for_task`), which would cause issues if the schema contains Unicode characters
- test: two existing tests had seemingly contradictory naming, and one test seemed to accidentally be setting `output_json_schema = None` instead of `input_json_schema = None`

## Related Issues

Part of a group of bugs caused by escaped Unicode: https://github.com/Kiln-AI/Kiln/issues/95

This seems like this was the last unicode-related issue I found - the remaining `json.dumps` are not serializing user-supplied data that could contain non-ASCII.

### 2. Documentation lift

* **`FieldInfo` interface**

  * Full Javadoc rewrite: clearer contract, param/return docs for every method, examples of bracket semantics.
  * Detailed explanation of `lookupClass` reflection path.

* **`AbstractFieldInfo`**

  * Added field-level Javadoc, ctor explanations and hash/equals clarifications.

* **Unsafe / reflection subclasses**

  * `VanillaFieldInfo`, `UnsafeFieldInfo` and the primitive specialisations (`IntFieldInfo`, `LongFieldInfo`, `CharFieldInfo`, `DoubleFieldInfo`, `ObjectFieldInfo`) now all include:

    * purpose + behaviour summary
    * param docs for ctors
    * notes on error handling and equality semantics.

### 1. Refactor Fault Propagation Strategy
**ADR Reference:** [Signal-Driven Fault Propagation](./doc/adr/0003-signal-driven-fault-propagation.md)

- Removed automatic ancestor faulting logic from `ExceptionHandlingMiddleware`.
- Instead, a counter is set that indicates if the activity or any of its descendants have a fault.
- This provides greater control, avoids premature faulting, and fixes bugs related to resumed activities not being able to complete workflows.

### 2. Simplify Bookmark Management
**ADR Reference:** [Direct Bookmark Management in WorkflowExecutionContext](./doc/adr/0004-direct-bookmark-management-in-workflowexecutioncontext.md)

- Repurposed the temporary `Bookmarks` list from `ActivityExecutionContext`.
- Activities now add bookmarks directly to `WorkflowExecutionContext.Bookmarks`.
- Fixes issues with bookmark cancellation after resumption.
- Eliminates the need for bookmark-copying middleware, simplifying execution flow and reducing state duplication.

### Benefits:
- Improved fault-tolerance and clarity around fault behavior.
- Cleaner bookmark lifecycle and support for cancellation on resume.
- Both changes are fully backward-compatible

2426309146,6538,Fix race condition in Distributed Workflow Runtime during same-workflow event publishing,sfmskywalker,938393,closed,2025-03-28T21:33:45Z,2025-03-31T16:11:27Z,2025-03-31T16:11:27Z,https://api.github.com/repos/elsa-workflows/elsa-core,https://github.com/elsa-workflows/elsa-core/pull/6538,"This PR fixes a race condition that occurs when a workflow publishes an event that targets itself while using the `DistributedWorkflowRuntime`.

### Problem
When a workflow instance is resumed, e.g. using a **Delay** activity, the Distributed Workflow Runtime acquires a distributed lock. If the resumed instance then executes a *Publish Event* activity targeting itself, it causes a deadlock (which will unlock after the lock acquisition timeout is exceeded). This happens because the `StimulusSender` tries to resume the instance again while the lock is still held, resulting in a timeout due to the lack of re-entrancy support.

### Cause
The issue stems from the `DistributedWorkflowRuntime` not supporting re-entrant calls. When the current instance publishes an event to itself, it attempts to resume while still holding the lock from the initial resumption, creating a conflict.

### Solution
This PR introduces a new service: `IStimulusDispatcher`. This service handles event delivery in a way that avoids re-entrancy issues by decoupling event publishing from immediate instance resumption. This resolves the deadlock scenario by preventing the current instance from trying to resume itself while holding the lock.

2300692501,6343,Controlled Commit States Feature Implementation,sfmskywalker,938393,closed,2025-01-27T19:39:27Z,2025-02-06T15:44:49Z,2025-02-06T15:44:49Z,https://api.github.com/repos/elsa-workflows/elsa-core,https://github.com/elsa-workflows/elsa-core/pull/6343,"This pull request implements the ""Controlled Commit States"" feature as described in issue #4835. This feature introduces fine-grained control over when a workflow commits its state to the underlying database, providing developers greater flexibility and configurability.

### Feature Overview

#### Workflow-Level Options
- Commit workflow state before it starts executing.
- Commit workflow state before an activity starts executing.
- Commit workflow state after an activity has executed.

These options can be enabled simultaneously to suit various use cases.

#### Activity-Level Options
- Commit workflow state before it starts executing.
- Commit workflow state after it has executed.
- Commit workflow state before it starts executing and after it has executed.
- Commit workflow state based on the setting at the workflow level.
- Never commit workflow state when this activity starts executing or has executed, regardless of the workflow-level setting.

Only one of the above activity-level options can be selected per activity.

#### Commit and Flush
Workflow state being committed is comprised of the following:

- Bookmarks
- Activity Execution Records
- Workflow Execution Records (cleared when committed, since this is append-only)
- Persistent Variables
- Workflow Instance

### Example Usage
The following demonstrates how to configure these options in code:

```csharp
public class SampleWorkflow : WorkflowBase
{
    protected override void Build(IWorkflowBuilder builder)
    {
        builder.WorkflowOptions.CommitStateOptions = new()
        {
            // Commit state before workflow starts executing.
            Starting = true,
            
            // Commit state before every activity that is about to execute.
            ActivityExecuting = true,
            
            // Commit state after every activity that executed.
            ActivityExecuted = true,
        };
        builder.Root = new Sequence
        {
            Activities =
            {
                new WriteLine(""Commit before executing"").WithCommitStateBehavior(ActivityCommitStateBehavior.Executing),
                new WriteLine(""Commit after executing"").WithCommitStateBehavior(ActivityCommitStateBehavior.Executed),
                new WriteLine(""Commit only based on the workflow commit options"").WithCommitStateBehavior(ActivityCommitStateBehavior.Default),
                new WriteLine(""Never commit the workflow when this activity is about to execute or has executed"").WithCommitStateBehavior(ActivityCommitStateBehavior.Never),
            }
        };
    }
}
```

### Elsa Studio UI Support
Elsa Studio has been updated to include UI support for configuring these commit state behaviors. This enhancement ensures users can conveniently manage these options via the graphical interface.

See https://github.com/elsa-workflows/elsa-studio/pull/385

### Documentation
Documentation updates will be provided to explain the new configuration options at both the workflow and activity levels.

### Notes
This PR significantly improves the configurability of workflows in Elsa, addressing scenarios where precise control over state persistence is required.

---

### 1️⃣  New unit-tests

* **`AffinityLockTest`**
  * Verifies non-binding acquisition leaves the calling thread’s mask unchanged.
  * Confirms illegal CPU IDs and double-bind scenarios raise/behave as expected.
* **`FileLockLockCheckTest`**
  * Covers lock-file deletion while held and requests for CPUs with no lock file.
* **`LockCheckTest`**
  * Adds negative-PID sanity check.
  
_Total: +49 LOC in `AffinityLockTest` and +30 +  lines in lock-checker tests._

---

### 2️⃣  Java 9+ support & misc fixes

| Area | Update |
|------|--------|
| **Maven native profile** | `make-c` now activates only on **Linux x86_64** (skips ARM and non-Linux builds). |
| **Boot class-path scanner** | `BootClassPath` falls back to walking the modular **`jrt:/`** filesystem when `sun.boot.class.path` is absent (JDK 9+). |
| **Process ID retrieval** | New util `Utilities.currentProcessId()` uses `ProcessHandle.current().pid()` when available; all PID calls routed through it (`LockCheck`, `NullAffinity`, macOS/Solaris impls, etc.). |
| **LockCheck** | Guards `getProcessForCpu()` on unsupported OS, uses new PID helper. |
| **WindowsJNAAffinity** | Safer “set affinity” verification and SLF4J-parameterised logging. |
| **Generic logging / warnings** | Switched to parameterised SLF4J in several files. |
| **BootClassPathTest** | No longer restricted to JDK 8. |

---

### Behavioural notes

* Invalid CPU-ID acquisition now returns an *unbound* lock instead of throwing, so assertions were adjusted in tests.
* Lock-file logic robust to manual deletion on disk.
* Java 11+ builds succeed without additional flags; class-path scanning works inside modules.


> These changes strengthen edge-case validation and ensure the library runs cleanly on modern JDK versions while keeping legacy behaviour intact.

2539572445,180,AffinityLock.acquireCore should lock/unlock all cpus ie 2 when hypert…,peter-lawrey,1070321,closed,2025-05-23T11:17:41Z,2025-06-03T10:13:26Z,2025-06-03T10:13:26Z,https://api.github.com/repos/OpenHFT/Java-Thread-Affinity,https://github.com/OpenHFT/Java-Thread-Affinity/pull/180,"This change makes **`AffinityLock.acquireCore()`** correctly reserve *all* logical
CPUs that share the same physical core (e.g. both SMT / Hyper-Threads).  
It touches the lock inventory, PID-file handling and CPU-layout APIs, plus adds
new verification tests.

---

### ✨ Behavioural changes

| Area | What changed |
|------|--------------|
| **Whole-core locking** | `AffinityLock.acquireCore()` now locks *both* hyper-threads on the target core, preventing other threads or JVMs from binding to the sibling logical CPU. |
| **AffinityLock** | • Added secondary field `cpuId2` to track the paired logical CPU.<br>• Hex mask parsing uses `Long.parseUnsignedLong` (fixes > 64-bit masks).<br>• `acquireLock(int)` returns *noLock* (not exception) when CPU id is out-of-range.<br>• `acquireLock(int[])` silently skips invalid ids with a log warning. |
| **CPU layout API** | New method `int pair(int cpuId)` returns the hyper-thread twin (0 if not HT). Implemented in `VanillaCpuLayout`; stubbed in `NoCpuLayout`. |
| **Lock-file plumbing** | `LockChecker` & `FileLockBasedLockChecker` upgraded so `obtainLock()` can atomically grab two lock files (`cpu`, `cpuId2`). PID logging & replace logic updated accordingly. |
| **LockInventory** | Generates locks with both `cpuId` and its `pair()`. Whole-core acquisition path passes both ids to `LockCheck`. |

---

### 🛠️  API surface changes

* **`CpuLayout`** – + `pair(int cpuId)`  
* **`LockChecker.obtainLock(int cpu1, int cpu2, String meta)`** – supersedes old 2-arg variant (now removed).  
  *Internal interfaces only – no public-API break for typical callers.*

---

### 🧪  Tests

| New / updated | Purpose |
|---------------|---------|
| `VanillaCpuLayoutPairTest` | Validates `pair()` mapping on sample i7 & i3 cpuinfo. |
| `AffinityLockTest` | Adds checks that `acquireCore()` reserves *all* logical CPUs of a core and updates existing expectations to dual-id locks. |
| `FileLockLockCheckTest`, `LockCheckTest` | Updated for new `updateCpu` / `replacePid` signatures. |

Total diff **+170 / -47** (mostly tests & lock-plumbing).

---

### ✅  Compatibility & Migration

* No user-facing API is removed; internal service providers updated.
* Existing code that calls `LockChecker.obtainLock()` directly must adopt the
  new 3-arg form (very rare outside this repo).

---

It touches **_only_ the `src/test` tree** – no production code is modified.

| Test class | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| **`AffinityLockDumpLocksTest`** | Verifies `dumpLocks()` lists all threads currently holding locks. |
| **`AffinityLockReleaseTest`** | Ensures `AffinityLock.release()` restores the mask to `BASE_AFFINITY`. |
| **`AffinityResetToBaseAffinityTest`** | Confirms `Affinity.resetToBaseAffinity()` resets the calling thread correctly. |
| **`AffinityThreadFactoryTest`** | Checks that threads created by `AffinityThreadFactory` each bind to a distinct CPU (Linux only). |
| **`CpuInfoLayoutMappingTest`** | Regression test for parsing `/proc/cpuinfo` into a correct logical-to-physical map. |
| **`UtilitiesTest`** | Edge-case conversions for `Utilities.toHexString` and `toBinaryString` with high/empty bits. |
| **`VanillaCpuLayoutPropertiesParseTest`** | Parses sample `.properties` layouts (i3, dual-Xeon, dual-E5405) and validates counts. |

*(Three helper classes extend `BaseAffinityTest` to reuse temporary-dir handling and Linux checks.)*

 Improves confidence in affinity-lock lifecycle, CPU-layout parsing, and utility helpers.

It **does not change runtime behaviour**; all modifications are cosmetic or defensive.

| Area | Examples | What changed |
|------|----------|--------------|

| **Assertions & validations** | `AffinityLock`, `LockInventory`, tests | • Added explicit `IllegalArgumentException` checks for invalid `cpuId`.<br>• Converted `assertTrue(!x)` to `assertFalse(x)` for clarity.<br>• Removed dead code comments. |
| **Lambda / SAM conversions** | `AffinityThreadFactory`, several tests | • Replaced anonymous classes with lambdas & method refs. |
| **Type & null safety** | `BootClassPath`, `VersionHelper`, `VanillaCpuLayout` | • Added `@NotNull`, `StandardCharsets.UTF_8`, and `.isEmpty()` idioms. |
| **Formatting & whitespace** | Many files | • Consistent spacing, braces, and indentation. |

| **Minor refactors** | `OSGiBundleTest`, `OSGiTestBase` | • Simplified temp variables; removed redundant initialisations. |

* downstream users reading the source,
* future maintainers running static-analysis tools,
* IDE inspections (fewer warnings).

**Description of the Change**
wxFont, wxPen, and wxBrush has deprecations for formatting, such as the font's family name, weight, style.  This PR updates these.  For example, wxSWISS is updated to wxFONTFAMILY_SWISS.

Please note that #6098 also mentions a deprecation with wxTimerEvent.  I believe fixing this deprecation is different than the styling, and has the potential to affect performance if not addressed correctly.  Therefore, I feel that should be a separate PR.

⏱️ Runtime :   **`125 nanoseconds`**  **→** **`83.0 nanoseconds`** (best of `187` runs)
### 📝 Explanation and details

Here is a more optimized version of your program.



**Optimizations made:**
- Added `__slots__ = ()` to prevent the overhead of the instance `__dict__` since the class does not define any instance attributes.
- Changed `return` to `pass` since `return` is unnecessary in `__init__` without a value.

This is controlled by setting the provisionally called `gateway_managed_virtual_layer` flag to true in the config.

```yaml
gateways:
  local:
    connection:
      type: postgres
      ...

  bigquery_gw:
    connection:
      type: bigquery
    variables:
      overriden_var: 'bigquery'

  snowflake_gw:
    connection:
      type: snowflake
      database: db1
      ...
    variables:
      overriden_var: 'snowflake'

default_gateway: postgres

gateway_managed_virtual_layer: true
```

In this case the virtual layer will be created by the specific gateway instead of using the default gateway, which means that the catalog doesn't need to be shared between the gateways. Also the gateway specific catalog will be set for each corresponding model and the gateway specific variables will take precedence over global ones for the gateway-specified in the model.

The default behaviour remains unchanged when the flag is set to false or omitted from the config.",Human,Python,2818.0,321.0,https://github.com/TobikoData/sqlmesh,TobikoData/sqlmesh,human

2405425459,3916,fix(weave): Fixing filtering calls table by boolean,neutralino1,429433,closed,2025-03-20T01:13:27Z,2025-03-20T19:30:36Z,2025-03-20T19:30:36Z,https://api.github.com/repos/wandb/weave,https://github.com/wandb/weave/pull/3916,"## Description

- Fixes WB-23754

We use a `LIKE` optimization for ""heavy"" conditions. The `LIKE` condition template wraps the literal value in double quotes, which is good for strings, but boolean literals are not wrapped in quotes in JSON payloads.

One corner case of this fix is that when filtering by strings `""true""` or `""false""` (not the boolean), the optimization may also match any call with strings containing those substrings (e.g. `""trued""`). This is not a concern as the final filtering would remove those (tested). It just makes the optimization slightly less optimal in those rare corner cases.

## Testing

How was this PR tested?

- tested manually with boolean values and string values `""true""`.
- modified the `test_query_heavy_column_simple_filter_with_order_and_limit_and_mixed_query_conditions` unit test to cover the boolean case.",Human,Python,1031.0,139.0,https://github.com/wandb/weave,wandb/weave,human

## Dependency updates

We use [`syft`](https://github.com/anchore/syft) to generate a SBOM for the latest connector version and the one from the PR.
It allows us to spot the dependencies that have been updated at all levels and for all types of dependencies (system, python, java etc.).
Here are the dependencies that have been updated compared to `airbyte/source-eventee:latest`.
Keep in mind that `:latest` does not always match the connector code on the main branch. 
It is the latest released connector image when the head commit of this branch was created.

## Dependency updates

We use [`syft`](https://github.com/anchore/syft) to generate a SBOM for the latest connector version and the one from the PR.
It allows us to spot the dependencies that have been updated at all levels and for all types of dependencies (system, python, java etc.).
Here are the dependencies that have been updated compared to `airbyte/source-signnow:latest`.
Keep in mind that `:latest` does not always match the connector code on the main branch. 
It is the latest released connector image when the head commit of this branch was created.

This was a miss when migration to the latest protocol occurred. We used to check if a match existed, and there seems to be some URIs that don't follow this pattern (like 'https://client_name.sharepoint.com/Pages/some_page.aspx'). I will investigate further but this should mitigate the case.

It did what I would have done... but faster, and tbh, more thorougly. Do you want this normalizer to be pulled up from the MotherDuck destination to be a reusable utility?

## What
Replaces LowerCaseNormalizer with UnicodeAwareNormalizer in MotherDuck destination connector to preserve Unicode characters in column names while maintaining ASCII compatibility.

- Resolves customer issue with Japanese column names like ""税率""
- Preserves Unicode letters/numbers using Unicode-aware regex
- Maintains existing LowerCaseNormalizer behavior for ASCII inputs
- Adds comprehensive unit tests covering 30 test cases
- Verified DuckDB compatibility with Unicode table names


## User Impact
Hopefully internationalized table names now work. DuckDB supports basically any name you throw at it.

## Dependency updates

We use [`syft`](https://github.com/anchore/syft) to generate a SBOM for the latest connector version and the one from the PR.
It allows us to spot the dependencies that have been updated at all levels and for all types of dependencies (system, python, java etc.).
Here are the dependencies that have been updated compared to `airbyte/source-lemlist:latest`.
Keep in mind that `:latest` does not always match the connector code on the main branch. 
It is the latest released connector image when the head commit of this branch was created.

Implement file-transfer feature for source-google-drive

Resolves [[source-google-drive] Add file transfers support to google drive](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/issues/51540)

- [x] Config option to use file-transfer mode
- [x] In file transfer mode, file filtering glob is still applied
- [x] Fetch all files maching the filters, extract them as the corresponding office format (docx for docs, ditto spreadsheets and presentations, pdf for all else)

Doc ref: [Export MIME types for Google Workspace documents](https://developers.google.com/drive/api/guides/ref-export-formats)

| Google MIME Type                                  | Equivalent MIME Type for export                                     | File Extension |

- [x] Transfer these raw files with file transfers mode, do NOT put them thorugh unstructured flow. 
   @natikgadzhi To be more precise about this point, ""Unstructured,"" along with other options, is a format type that we only support for transfer records mode, and format is ignored for transfer files; if in the future we want to have unstructured or any other format supported when transferring files some extra work would be required.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b731b06c-4e46-4314-9ec5-e262d1d7b73d)
 
- [x] Using unstructured.io is still available in the flow that exists today

## How
It updated the spec to show the option that leverages cdk logic to handle the new record type and add `file_size()` and `get_file()` to the stream reader.

## Review guide

1. `airbyte-integrations/connectors/source-google-drive/source_google_drive/stream_reader.py`:  file_size() and get_file() to the stream reader, also updates on `_get_export_mime_type` and `_is_exportable_document`.
2. `airbyte-integrations/connectors/source-google-drive/integration_tests/spec.json`: update spec.
3. `docs/integrations/sources/google-drive.md`: updated doc.
4. `airbyte-integrations/connectors/source-google-drive/metadata.yaml`: updated base image as old couldn't handle python 3.10.


## User Impact

If they just need to move files as they are, this will greatly improve users' experience as sync will be quite fast.

## Dependency updates

We use [`syft`](https://github.com/anchore/syft) to generate a SBOM for the latest connector version and the one from the PR.
It allows us to spot the dependencies that have been updated at all levels and for all types of dependencies (system, python, java etc.).
Here are the dependencies that have been updated compared to `airbyte/source-employment-hero:latest`.
Keep in mind that `:latest` does not always match the connector code on the main branch. 
It is the latest released connector image when the head commit of this branch was created.

* Added type annotations to functions and variables in `src/integrations/prefect-docker/prefect_docker/deployments/steps.py` to improve code clarity and type checking. [[1]](diffhunk://#diff-3f40bcfdb088269ff630005eab5d7b9f51ebf44937ac6317c65517c1b14b497fR26-R55) [[2]](diffhunk://#diff-3f40bcfdb088269ff630005eab5d7b9f51ebf44937ac6317c65517c1b14b497fL88-R104) [[3]](diffhunk://#diff-3f40bcfdb088269ff630005eab5d7b9f51ebf44937ac6317c65517c1b14b497fL120-R129)
* Updated `STEP_OUTPUT_CACHE` to use a more specific type annotation for better type safety.

### Docker Image Namespace Handling:
* Introduced logic to handle default Docker image namespaces using `PREFECT_DEFAULT_DOCKER_BUILD_NAMESPACE` in `build_docker_image` and `push_docker_image` functions. [[1]](diffhunk://#diff-3f40bcfdb088269ff630005eab5d7b9f51ebf44937ac6317c65517c1b14b497fR190-R200) [[2]](diffhunk://#diff-3f40bcfdb088269ff630005eab5d7b9f51ebf44937ac6317c65517c1b14b497fL265-R281) [[3]](diffhunk://#diff-3f40bcfdb088269ff630005eab5d7b9f51ebf44937ac6317c65517c1b14b497fR336-R343)
* Added new tests to verify that the default namespace is respected and that explicitly provided namespaces take precedence.

### Test Enhancements:
* Added type annotations to test functions in `tests/cli/test_deploy.py` for better type checking and readability.

This occurs when the capsh --decode command encounters invalid input or errors, and the error output is then further sent along and causes the errors to be processed. 

It seems like that certain capability values (especially `ffffffffffffffff`) could cause `capsh --decode` to hang or output unexpected results

I made the following Changes:
1. Added regex validation to ensure `cap_value` contains only valid hexadecimal characters before processing
2. Added error redirection (`2>/dev/null`) to prevent error messages from being processed
3. Implemented fallback messaging when invalid capability formats are come across


I will also add the details of the code changed down here. Note in one or two lines i figured their could be more POSIX complaint ways of doing something so I added it as a comment in case you prefer it that way. Let me know if there are any issues;

We don't currently have GPU code coverage, so changes which occur there will lead to a lot of codecov annotations on the gpu code, which at first glance it hard to remove.  If/when we include gpu support in codecov, move to line coverage, and increase coverage, then we can turn them back on.

PR should start as a draft, then move to ready for review state after CI is passed and all applicable checkboxes are closed.
This approach ensures that reviewers don't spend extra time asking for regular requirements.

You can remove a checkbox as not applicable only if it doesn't relate to this PR in any way.
For example, PR with docs update doesn't require checkboxes for performance while PR with any change in actual code should have checkboxes and justify how this code change is expected to affect performance (or justification should be self-evident).

Configure Spotless to automatically remove unused imports.

# Motivation
Clean code.

# Additional Notes
After investigating, I found that Spotless does not support expanding wildcard imports when using google-java-format, which is what we're currently using. This behavior is only supported by eclipse-java-format.

Switching to the Eclipse formatter would introduce a large number of formatting changes, which we want to avoid for now.

As a compromise, this PR enables removeUnusedImports() via Spotless to help clean up unnecessary imports automatically.
For wildcard imports, we’ll handle them manually as needed and enforce their avoidance during code review to prevent them from being merged.

2496892442,104,Easily track span duration within rollouts,corbt,176426,closed,2025-05-03T14:52:55Z,2025-05-07T06:09:45Z,2025-05-07T06:09:45Z,https://api.github.com/repos/OpenPipe/ART,https://github.com/OpenPipe/ART/pull/104,"I ran into an issue on my current project where the llm-as-judge I was using was taking a super long time to return, bottlenecking the whole rollout process and leading to low GPU utilization.

This change makes it easy to track the duration of different parts of your rollout with a context manager. For example, to track how long an LLM-as-judge contained within a function takes, you could do the following:

```python
async with traj.track_duration(""determine_if_answer_is_correct""):
    rubric.answer_correct = await determine_if_answer_is_correct(
        final_answer, scenario
    )
```

This will automatically add a new metric, `determine_if_answer_is_correct_duration`, which tracks the cumulative duration (in seconds) spent within the context manager.

I also add a new optional method to trajectories, `.finish()` When called, this will add a metric `duration` that tracks the total trajectory duration from start to finish.

Separately, this PR makes it explicit that metrics can be boolean or ints. This mostly already worked bc python will accept `int` in most places that expect `float`, and `bool` is a subclass of `int` in Python (!), but adding it to the types makes it more obvious.

Also fixes a minor type error in the art-e example. We should probably enable automatic typechecking as part of PRs at some point.",Human,Python,8059.0,643.0,https://github.com/OpenPipe/ART,OpenPipe/ART,human
2461648574,51,More flexible TrainableModel,corbt,176426,closed,2025-04-15T20:05:42Z,2025-04-15T22:58:13Z,2025-04-15T22:58:12Z,https://api.github.com/repos/OpenPipe/ART,https://github.com/OpenPipe/ART/pull/51,"This PR makes a few changes to the API shape, specifically focused on `Model` and `LocalAPI`.

It introduces an abstraction where we separate out `PolicyModel`, which could be any LLM, and a `TrainablePolicyModel`, which is specifically a policy that can be trained by our system. This will let us log trajectories from both `PolicyModel` and `TrainablePolicyModel` in a unified way.

It also adds a new `config` field to `PolicyModel`. This is opaque to our system, but is something we can log to wandb and our file system in the future to track hparams associated with each model run. I'm using the config field in the following way:

```python
agent_002 = art.TrainablePolicyModel(
    name=""email-agent-002"",
    project=""email_agent"",
    base_model=""Qwen/Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct"",
    config=ProjectPolicyConfig(
        max_turns=10,
        training_config=TrainingConfig(
            trajectories_per_group=6,
            groups_per_step=1,
            learning_rate=1.2e-5,
            eval_steps=30,
            val_set_size=100,
            training_dataset_size=4000,
            batch_size=8,
            num_epochs=4,
        ),
    ),
)

agent_004 = agent_002.model_copy(deep=True)
assert isinstance(agent_004.config, ProjectPolicyConfig)
agent_004.name = ""email-agent-004""
agent_004.config.max_turns = 30
```

And then within my training and rollout functions, adjusting behavior based on the config above. I find this pattern helps me stay sane by tracking what properties each model was called with, and keeping a record around of old training runs (by keeping the old config in the codebase).",Human,Python,8059.0,643.0,https://github.com/OpenPipe/ART,OpenPipe/ART,human

<p>mkdocs-material-9.6.12 (2025-04-17)</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed <a href=""https://redirect.github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material/issues/8158"">#8158</a>: Flip footnote back reference icon for right-to-left languages</li>
</ul>
<p>mkdocs-material-9.6.11 (2025-04-01)</p>
<ul>
<li>Updated Docker image to latest Alpine Linux</li>
<li>Bump required Jinja version to 3.1</li>
<li>Fixed <a href=""https://redirect.github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material/issues/8133"">#8133</a>: Jinja filter <code>items</code> not available (9.6.10 regression)</li>
<li>Fixed <a href=""https://redirect.github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material/issues/8128"">#8128</a>: Search plugin not entirely disabled via enabled setting</li>
</ul>
<p>mkdocs-material-9.6.10 (2025-03-30)</p>
<p>This version is a pure refactoring release, and does not contain new features
or bug fixes. It strives to improve the compatibility of our templates with
alternative Jinja-like template engines that we're currently exploring,
including minijinja.</p>
<p>Additionally, it replaces several instances of Python function invocations
with idiomatic use of template filters. All instances where variables have
been mutated inside templates have been replaced. Most changes have been made
in partials, and only a few in blocks, and all of them are fully backward
compatible, so no changes to overrides are necessary.</p>
<p>Note that this release does not replace the Jinja template engine with
minijinja. However, our templates are now 99% compatible with minijinja,
which means we can explore alternative Jinja-compatible implementations.
Additionally, immutability and removal of almost all Python function
invocations means much more idiomatic templating.</p>

This PR introduces the support of LoRAs for fal-ai, this should not be merged until the server-side [PR](https://github.com/huggingface-internal/moon-landing/pull/13246) is merged (private).

## Changes
- update `_prepare_mapped_model` to return a `ProviderMappingInfo` object. This object returns the provider id, the hf model id (optional) and the lora weights path (optional) that is expected to be sent in the payload. 
- update `_prepare_payload_as_dict` and `_prepare_payload_as_bytes` signatures to accept a `ProviderMappingInfo` object as an argument. 

the logic is implemented within the `TaskProviderHelper` base class, to avoid duplicating similar logic when we support LoRAs for the other providers. Note that LoRAs can also be used with other tasks like `text-to-video` as instance.

2494027419,13683,SAK-51450 SiteStats replace custom SakaiPagingNavigator with standard Wicket 9 components,ottenhoff,810505,closed,2025-05-01T15:42:13Z,2025-05-05T12:29:18Z,2025-05-05T12:29:18Z,https://api.github.com/repos/sakaiproject/sakai,https://github.com/sakaiproject/sakai/pull/13683,"I could not get the custom pager to work. Moving to standard Wicket 9 components makes the most sense to me.

-----------------

This commit refactors the pagination in SiteStats to use standard Wicket 9 components instead of custom ones:

1. Removed custom SakaiPagingNavigator.java and its HTML template
2. Updated SakaiNavigationToolBar to use the standard AjaxPagingNavigator component
3. Moved row size selector functionality to a separate component in SakaiNavigationToolBar
4. Updated SakaiNavigationToolBar.html template to include the row size selector element
5. Added null check to prevent duplicate component IDs when the toolbar is re-rendered

The refactoring preserves all the original functionality while removing custom code that is no longer needed with Wicket 9, making future maintenance easier.

2. We confirmed the bean.setItemData(item) call was already present in the QuestionScoreListener class.
3. We added code to ensure that itemData is properly set even when sorting by modifying the QuestionScoreUpdateListener class to check if itemData is null and set it if needed.
4. We imported the necessary classes to make this work.

## 📝 General Information
### Description
Integrates the Sanskrit Poetry Environment from KhoomeiK's contribution, enabling training of language models to generate authentic Sanskrit verse that adheres to traditional metrical patterns. This environment combines computational linguistics with cultural preservation, using the chandas (meter) classification system to validate poetic accuracy.

The integration includes:
- **ChandasMeterReward**: New reward function added to the registry for metrical validation
- **Sanskrit Poetry Environment**: Moved to `environments/community/sanskrit_poetry/`
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Added as entry #25 in community README
- **Code Quality**: All pre-commit checks passing with proper formatting

This PR introduces `ContainerPort` and `ContainerImage` types to replace the ad‑hoc string expressions currently used to represent the values.

The port parameter remains a string for backward compatibility and we fix an issue where a string was passed to values that expect an int by using an `AsInt` cast.

## Customer Impact

Customers are unable to use Azure AppInsights, OpenAI, and CosmosDB existing resources. It will always try provisioning new resources even when calling ""AsExisting"". For Azure Redis, using AsExisting doesn't work because the bicep fails to deploy since we are setting properties on an existing resource. See https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/bicep-core-diagnostics#BCP173

## Testing

New bicep tests for these scenarios added.

## Risk

Low. Since we are changing the bicep generation code to support existing resources, we may affect the bicep generation of new resources. But existing bicep baseline tests are passing. The only test that required a change was for AppInsights, but that is a simple resource reordering in bicep, which shouldn't affect it.

Previously, when upserting a resource, the visibility function passed to `UpdateFromResource` would return false in the event that any value in the dictionary was false. For example, if `container` and `project` are values, `container` is marked as hidden (false), and then a resource of type `project` is updated, `project` will then be set to hidden. This is incorrect. Instead, the value should be visible if it was previously visible in the dictionary or if it's new (ie, when stopping a command, you may see the state `Stopping` for the first time).

- Adds icons to the resource grid that are the same as the ones from the graph.
- Hides the resource type column, resource type can be toggled in options and is the tooltip for the icon.

I started out thinking about how to add custom icons for a resource, so that Redis for example could use the Redis logo. This felt like a good first part of that. After this, if we want, we can add an annotation for an icon and add it to the protocol. Then this would be the fallback for when there is no custom icon or if the resource server doesn't implement custom icons. A dashboard running in prod would not have the icons for example.

I thought this PR would at least let us talk about if we want to do this or not and start progressing on the idea.

Some notes:

- Size: technically we should probably request a size from the icon helper and have it return the right Icon for that size since the actual icon can and does change for each size. However not all the icons exist for all sizes and the differences didn't seem to make a huge deal. So I left the size as the same one as we use in the graph and reduce it with styles.
- Color: I would have liked to not use WithColor and therefore avoid instantiating a new icon for each invocation, but it wasn't obvious to me how to do that with FluentIcon component. All the things I tried got messed with in some way. Maybe someone else can tell me.

Fixes https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/issues/6112

The health check service immediately checks health when a resource moves to a running state. However, if the intial report is unhealthy then it waits 5 seconds before checking again. This PR refactors the health check service to be more responsive.

* If a health report isn't healthy then the delay interval starts at 1 second and increases by 1 second per failure up to the existing 5 sec. Healthy delay is still 30 seconds.
* Refactored the health check loop to use an instant interrupt instead of polling the state once per second. The `DelayAsync` method is complicated, but the actual health monitoring loop is much simpler.
* Allow setting the health delays from tests so time based tests run a lot faster. No more 30 second tests.
* No more blocking in tests: `AutoResetEvent` 👎

Introduce a new annotation `AzureFunctionsAnnotation` to represent Azure Functions resources in Aspire. This annotation allows for the configuration of Azure Functions resources, including setting the kind of Azure Functions to be used with Azure Container Apps (ACA).

This change ensures that when Azure Functions are deployed as part of an Azure Container App, the kind is set to ""functionapp"" by default. This is necessary to ensure that the Azure Functions are correctly recognized and managed within the Azure Container Apps environment.

Resolves #9139
Resolves #9145

The underlying issue is attributed to a lack of health checks for child resources (as those have no lifetime of their own). In the nutshell, whenever an Azurite emulator is starting up, the readiness of the emulator is indicated by the readiness of the ""blobs"" resources (represented by `BloblServiceClient`). Previously, child blob contrainers were created on `ResourceReadyEvent`, but this created an opportunity for a race condition - a client could attempt to connect _after_ the resource reported healthy but _before_ child resources were created - the flaky test highlighted this problem.

To fix the issue we're now creating an individual health check for each blob container resource. To make it simple, a blob container is being created within the health check itself.",Human,C#,5255.0,763.0,https://github.com/dotnet/aspire,dotnet/aspire,human

Taking over https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/15191. 

The `mlflow.evaluation.Assessment` will be deprecated in favor of the new `mlflow.entity.Assessment`. However, we cannot remove it in 2.x because there are some important usage in DBX such as Agent Evaluation. Therefore, this PR make non-breaking adjustments so that those use cases can migrate to 3.x smoothly.

Also, the `trace_id` and timestamp fields in the new `mlflow.entity.Assessment` entity becomes optional, so that users can create a stand-alone Assessment object. This is a valid use case of Agent Evaluation, so supporting it is necessary to make migration happen. For example, [a custom metric definition](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/generative-ai/agent-evaluation/custom-metrics) that returns a stand-alone Assessment object (which will be later logged to backend by evaluator).

The following code ends up calling `get_experiment(None)`:

```

mlflow.set_tracking_uri(""databricks"")
mlflow.set_experiment(""/users/harutaka.kawamura@databricks.com/test-test"")
#                       ^ must be capitalized
```

and throws:

```
mlflow.exceptions.RestException: RESOURCE_DOES_NOT_EXIST: Could not find experiment with ID None.
```

Instead, it should fail with the root cause which is `/users/harutaka.kawamura@databricks.com` does not exist.

### What changes are proposed in this pull request?

Fixed linting errors in GenAI documentation by replacing non-existent `mlflow.active_experiment()` function calls with proper `mlflow.start_run()` pattern. The changes affect connection verification examples in the connect-environment.mdx file, making them use valid MLflow API calls and simplifying the code structure.

### How is this PR tested?

- [x] Existing unit/integration tests
- [ ] New unit/integration tests

### What changes are proposed in this pull request?

The `__init__` file for flavors are massive. This is ok, but becomes a challenge for the lightweight tracing SDK, because doing `mlflow.openai.autolog()` imports everything defined in the `mlflow/openai/__init__.py`, including various model logging dependencies.

On the other hand, a good example is DSPy flavor, which organize code well and keep `__init__.py` clean.

This PR moves model logging code from `__init__.py` to `model.py` so we can later choose to import or not inside the `__init__.py`. This only updates three flavors that are problematic for tracing SDK: `openai`, `langchain`, and `llama_index`, but we can apply same to other flavors later.

**Note**: This PR targets to **mlflow-3** branch rather than the feature branch, because this will cause huge merge conflict otherwise.

### What changes are proposed in this pull request?

#### Problem
https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/16004 added `@trace_disabled` tag to scorers execution. This was for making sure custom scorers do not generate traces in evaluation run. Currently, the evaluation result page simply show all traces in the Run, so having such extra traces breaks the result and metric aggregation.

However, the above change caused a thread-safety problem. In evaluation harness, model prediction and scorer execution is done concurrently in a thread pool for performance optimization. Trace disabling is global, not thread local, so the above disablement logic sometimes causes side effect that predict_fn does not generate traces. This is a regression.

#### Short-term Solution (this PR)

Unfortunately, disabling tracing in thread-local way is quite challenging. Therefore, we take the following approach as a short-term fix.
1. Just let traces generated from scorers.
2. Once evaluation harness completes, run `mlflow.search_traces()` to get traces in the evaluation run.
3. Traces generated from predict function always have `eval.requestId` tag. Therefore, we can determine extra traces by checking the existence of this tag.
4. Delete these extra traces by calling `mlflow.delete_traces()`.

#### Long-term Solution

From product perspective, we should actually allow those extra traces to be generated. For example, users may want to check the OpenAI LLM call inside their LLM-as-a-Judge scorers.

Therefore, the fundamental problem is how we display evaluation results. It should not just show all traces in the run, but instead filter them by certain criteria e.g. if the trace has assessment created by the evaluation. Post-DAIS, we will change how traces are associated with Run and how evaluation result page fetches list of traces to show. After that change, we should be able to remove this hack.

### What changes are proposed in this pull request?

While testing review app, I found `mlflow.search_traces()` doesn't handle traces written from Review App properly.

```
TypeError: 'float' object cannot be interpreted as an integer
File <command-6122023941645961>, line 1
----> 1 mlflow.search_traces(run_id=my_session.mlflow_run_id)
```

After closer look, the start time of the span is set to be `float` somehow. This is a bug in review app side (they log json directly), but adding casting in mlflow side to fix it immediately.

As title: make PythonModel with type hints work in spark_udf
Critical changes:
1. Allow MapType in spark_udf
2. pandas_udf might implicitly convert lists into numpy arrays, so we need to convert it back before validating data against type hint
3. Refactor a bit by reusing pydantic_utils

### What changes are proposed in this pull request?

Sometimes when running the build-docs job via release pipeline, Maven central rate-limits us, causing the job to fail. To avoid this, we write a temporary `/tmp/settings.xml` file and pass it to maven via `mvn ... -s /tmp/settings.xml`.

In order to get this extra option to the maven command, it seems most convenient to read it from an env var.

Close #15764 

### What changes are proposed in this pull request?

**Issue**:  There was an inconsistency between the Python variable name (MLFLOW_CONFIGURE_LOGGING) and the environment variable name it checked for (MLFLOW_LOGGING_CONFIGURE_LOGGING).
**Fix**: I have updated the code in environment_variables.py to make the Python variable check for MLFLOW_CONFIGURE_LOGGING environment  variable instead, aligning the names.
**Testing**: I have added test_mlflow_configure_logging_env_var() to tests/utils/test_logging_utils.py that verifies:
    - When MLFLOW_CONFIGURE_LOGGING=False, MLflow doesn't configure loggers
    - When MLFLOW_CONFIGURE_LOGGING=True, MLflow does configure loggers

It is common for DSPy models to receive multiple arguments, but MLflow DSPy flavor does not allow models to receive multiple arguments. Therefore, the following code does not currently work.

```
import mlflow
import dspy

mlflow.set_experiment(""DSPy"")

lm = dspy.LM(""openai/gpt-4o-mini"")
dspy.settings.configure(lm=lm)

dspy_program = dspy.ChainOfThought(""question, context -> answer"")

with mlflow.start_run():
    model_info = mlflow.dspy.log_model(
        dspy_program,
        ""dspy_program"",
        input_example={
            ""question"": ""What is LLM agent?"",
            ""context"": ""LLM agents are a type of AI agent that use LLMs to make decisions."",

In addition to some basic logical switching to make sure the wrong params aren't sent, the primary work here was to rethink some of the prompting (especially for gleanings) to request response lengths without resorting to hard parameter control via `max_tokens`, which is not possible when using `max_completion_tokens` in a reasoning model. The prompting is updated to request specific lengths from the model reasoning process directly.

On the search side, this also resolves an issue where we had individual model params that should be taken from the root model configs, so it removes things like temperature and top_p from the config objects.",Human,Python,29900.0,3156.0,https://github.com/microsoft/graphrag,microsoft/graphrag,human

Update to the latest preview of Microsoft.OpenApi ahead of preview3. Changes consumed:

- Tags are modeled as a set and handled correctly during deserialziation by M.A so we can remove our comparer implementation.
- Bug fix around serialization of date-based examples was resolved so we can remove the scrubbing in our snapshot tests.
- OpenApiReaderRegistry was deprecated in favor of registering supported readers on OpenApiReader settings.

This pull request enhances the handling of XML comments in OpenAPI operations by introducing support for `<returns>` and `<response>` tags. It ensures that these tags are correctly applied to operations with single or multiple response values, improving the generated OpenAPI documentation. Additionally, the changes include updates to tests and snapshots to validate the new behavior.

### Enhancements to XML Comment Handling:
* Added logic to apply `<returns>` tags to operations with a single response value, setting the response description to the `<returns>` content. (`src/OpenApi/gen/XmlCommentGenerator.Emitter.cs`, `[src/OpenApi/gen/XmlCommentGenerator.Emitter.csR375-R381](diffhunk://#diff-ccf1c2147f9ea676bdeaf8a0b062fc74276a1a893e4d0a6ef1fb56c96238162fR375-R381)`)

### Test Updates:
* Updated test cases in `OperationTests.MinimalApis.cs` to include `<returns>` and `<response>` tags in XML comments for various methods. (`[[1]](diffhunk://#diff-cbc2066e28b3f7018a9c4e5f6f4f59f9127c8e288588fad01a21bd6ebfaafa2eR58)`, `[[2]](diffhunk://#diff-cbc2066e28b3f7018a9c4e5f6f4f59f9127c8e288588fad01a21bd6ebfaafa2eR77-R84)`, `[[3]](diffhunk://#diff-cbc2066e28b3f7018a9c4e5f6f4f59f9127c8e288588fad01a21bd6ebfaafa2eR180)`, `[[4]](diffhunk://#diff-cbc2066e28b3f7018a9c4e5f6f4f59f9127c8e288588fad01a21bd6ebfaafa2eR189)`)
* Added assertions in tests to verify that `<returns>` and `<response>` descriptions are correctly reflected in the OpenAPI documentation. (`[[1]](diffhunk://#diff-cbc2066e28b3f7018a9c4e5f6f4f59f9127c8e288588fad01a21bd6ebfaafa2eR242)`, `[[2]](diffhunk://#diff-cbc2066e28b3f7018a9c4e5f6f4f59f9127c8e288588fad01a21bd6ebfaafa2eR294-R298)`)

### Snapshot Updates:
* Updated multiple snapshot files to reflect the new behavior of `<returns>` and `<response>` handling in OpenAPI documentation. (`[[1]](diffhunk://#diff-91078e9702b9a55fe1478810252bc53840a02f9ec275358e87290d4950643d99R357-R363)`, `[[2]](diffhunk://#diff-6cb2107c6fba63ce6c32d3b4424c02829aa35cef07e10cd61f092e76c1cf2f1aR386-R392)`, `[[3]](diffhunk://#diff-f064ebd886f03280e4efcd140628d796a13e49aaa10f4c20188838a990a37741R476-R482)`, `[[4]](diffhunk://#diff-bda468be16591f7a2a3bf7c0e2e2d046b6782d19671195bec1872d574710f6e7R361-R367)`, `[[5]](diffhunk://#diff-0622f0edd663548006798f175b67c7aae385ff0fedfddc3c088d4cb83804b0d2R379-R385)`, `[[6]](diffhunk://#diff-dd65270661ebbe5d36535c06b2090a880101451ed1e4e9d9ba796348aaeb7945R387-R393)`)",Human,C#,37535.0,10518.0,https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore,dotnet/aspnetcore,human

_Personally I try to have 0 (zero) warnings in my projects. I treat warning as potential error and when  there are a lot of warnings, people tent to completely ignore them. So I fixed all warnings that could be fixed – there remained 3 warnings regarding references._

## What is changed/fixed in this PR

Every change is a commit on its own.

- Activities were started twice. `ActivitySource.StartActivity` returns started activity, so later `activity.Start();` call was throwing an exception that already started activity cannot be started again.
- `FieldMappingToolOptions` wan not loaded correctly from configuration. The `Bind` call failed with exception, tah it cannot create an instance of interface/abstract classes. This was because of `FieldMaps` property, which is loaded manually, so I loaded manually even `Enabled` property.
- Fixed warnings related to non-existing `using`s and fields which were not initialized, so they had `null` value forever: `_options`/`_config`. I believe the processors with this errors could not work properly (or could not work at all).
- Updated (almost) all references to latest versions. I had some troubles and tried just tried this. It seems everything works – at least all tests are passing and my work items migration also works.
- Fixed calculating average and remainig time in work items migration. This was calculaten incorrectly – the average time was calculated as duration of **last processed item** divided by numer of processed items. So number of processed items is increasing but duration of last processed item is basically still the same (similar). So very quick the average time was very low and hence also the remainig time. In my case I have to migrate 10 000 work items. After migrating couple of hundreds (~400), the average time was very low and remaining time was reported as couple of minutes to complete 9 500 items, which is not possible. Now average time is calculated correctly as **total process time of all processed items** divided by count of processed items.
- Remove call of `SetEndTime` for activities. Basically that meant, that the activity duration was explicitly set to that timespan. This was second problem in calculating remaining time in work items migration.",Human,C#,579.0,373.0,https://github.com/nkdAgility/azure-devops-migration-tools,nkdAgility/azure-devops-migration-tools,human

The mappings were defined as dictionary, which does not have an order. The items added to dictionary are returned in random order. In case of mappings, we need to preserver the order of them, because we need them to be matched in order specified in configuration. This is important, because more than one mapping can match input value.

**This is a breaking change. The configuration of `TfsNodeStructureTool` must be changed after this change.**

## Example

Old configuration:

``` json
""TfsNodeStructureTool"": {
  ""Enabled"": true,
  ""Areas"": {
    ""Filters"": [],
    ""Mappings"": {
      ""Foo\\\\AAA\\\\123\\\\(.+)"": ""FooDest\\AAA\\$1"",
      ""Foo\\\\(.+)"": ""FooDest\\$1""    
    }
  }
}
```

New configuration:

``` json
""TfsNodeStructureTool"": {
  ""Enabled"": true,
  ""Areas"": {
    ""Filters"": [],
    ""Mappings"": [

From what I can tell, `traverse_sdfg_with_defined_symbols()` is supposed to traverse the SDFG, accumulating symbols as it runs down the tree.

The FontImageSource Icon color of the TabbedPage is not updated at run time.

### Root Cause

The SourceChanged event is not implemented for the IconImageSource in the Page.

### Description of Change

Implementing a source changed event listener for IconImageSource in the ImageSource call back. When the ImageSource changes are detected, manually triggering PropertyChanged for IconImageSource.This propagates the change through the UI update mechanism, ensuring the TabbedPage icon reflects the new state.

> It would be very helpful if you could [test the resulting artifacts](https://github.com/dotnet/maui/wiki/Testing-PR-Builds) from this PR and let us know in a comment if this change resolves your issue. Thank you!

### Root Cause of the issue 

- On both iOS and Windows, when OnColor is set to null, we assign a transparent color for the switch's `on` state. As a result, the native default `on` color is not applied.

### Description of Change

- Updated the logic to properly clear the color by setting it to null and removing the corresponding color keys on iOS and Windows.

- This ensures that when OnColor is not explicitly set, the native default `on` color is applied to the Switch as expected.

### Issues Fixed

Fixes #29693

### Tested the behaviour in the following platforms

- [x] iOS

2512893235,3483,Provide a default id for clear buttons in TextFields,HDinger,7457313,closed,2025-05-12T07:09:27Z,2025-05-14T17:36:53Z,2025-05-14T17:36:52Z,https://api.github.com/repos/primer/view_components,https://github.com/primer/view_components/pull/3483,"### What are you trying to accomplish?
Provide a default id for the clear button wihtin TextFields if `clear_button_id` is empty

### Integration
I don't think so..

#### List the issues that this change affects.
Closes #3482 

#### Risk Assessment
  <!-- Please select from one of the following and detail why this level was chosen -->

- [ ] **Low risk** the change is small, highly observable, and easily rolled back.
- [ ] **Medium risk** changes that are isolated, reduced in scope or could impact few users. The change will not impact library availability.
- [ ] **High risk** changes are those that could impact customers and SLOs, low or no test coverage, low observability, or slow to rollback.

### What approach did you choose and why?
I used `SecureRandom.uuid` to provide a randomized ID. The `generate_id` method is only available in the scope of `Primer::Component` but not in `Primer::Forms::Dsl` 

### Merge checklist

- [ ] Added/updated tests
- [ ] Added/updated documentation
- [ ] Added/updated previews (Lookbook)
- [x] Tested in Chrome
- [x] Tested in Firefox
- [x] Tested in Safari
- [x] Tested in Edge

- Re-enabling support for parsing format V6 and re-enabling the tests
- Removed support for ancient netperf format version 1 and 2 that were only used during .NET Core 2.0 (not even 2.1).
- The implementation of the Nettrace reader was doing a bunch of pinning because the TraceEvent internal model of events uses unmanaged pointers, however the pinning was creating bad GC performance. TraceEvent builds for .NET standard so we don't have guaranteed access to the pinned heap and I didn't want to start doing lots of copying and/or managing pools of pinned arrays. Instead I switched the stream reading over to using spans backed by native heap allocations and explicit block lifetime tracking. As a side benefit it also brings the V3-5 block iteration code a bit closer to the V6 block iteration and removed all the dependencies on the existing FastSerialization library.
- Add MinSupportedVersion and MaxSupportedVersion to the UnsupportedVersionException




@wiktork - This may fix the GC issues you were seeing in dotnet-monitor
@karpinsn - Exception improvements should help with version error messages in Dev18

@mdh1418, @brianrob, @lateralusX, @beaubelgrave - aside from turning back on V6 support hopefully the behavior should be nearly identical to before despite all the code churn in there.

This PR adds support for parsing a new V6 version of the NetTrace file format. The design of the format is described in the included NetTraceFormat.md. At the end of that doc is a summary of the changes between V5 and V6.

NOTE: The parser is capable of reading things that the higher level TraceEvent API doesn't yet expose such as event descriptions, optional trace metadata, 8 byte thread ids, new correlation identifiers, etc. I think Brian and I will need to work together outside the scope of this PR to decide if/how/when we expose parts of that data in TraceEvent's public API surface.

2365439544,2609,[Bugfix] Ensure aggregation and groupby nodes are properly handled in case tables have no fields to aggregate or groupby on,rohkhann,124841904,closed,2025-02-28T21:54:18Z,2025-03-03T20:01:27Z,2025-03-03T20:01:27Z,https://api.github.com/repos/Azure/data-api-builder,https://github.com/Azure/data-api-builder/pull/2609,"

## Why make this change?
When the table has no numeric types we were erroring out because of the way groupby and aggregation nodes are generated. This code handles logic where if there are no applicable groupby or aggregation nodes available for an entity we do not generate those nodes for that entity

## What is this change?

Refactored enum generation logic in GraphQL schema creation to ensure enums are created only when necessary. Updated methods in EnumTypeBuilder to return success status and renamed `GenerateFieldsEnum` to `TryGenerateEnum`. Added a new parameter in SchemaConverter for conditional aggregation node generation.

Added `date_only_table` to SQL schemas with sample data. Updated configuration files to include the new entity and permissions. Added tests to validate non-generation of aggregation nodes without numeric fields.

## How was this tested?

tests added.

Closes https://github.com/Azure/data-api-builder/issues/2463

Added an integration test to validate we can do an insert when including the primary keys in the body of the request when request-body-strict is false and those primary keys are auto-generated.

This PR does two things:
1. It updates the ExtractInterfaceOptionsService to pull the services it needs from the document being worked against. This will have it work in the same manner as ExtractClassOptionsService. This also removes the need for Roslyn LSP or O# to implement an INotificationService since it is only needed in the VisualStudioExtractInferfaceOptionsService.
2. A change was previously made to have extract class early return if the workspace did not support AddFile operations.

### Context
Looking at a trace of allocations. It was shown that some of the allocations were coming from closures. This pr addresses the closures found.

### Changes Made
* Removed lazy from exclude tester function since it was not needed since lifetime of lazy object was within the method itself.
* switched from linq clause for add range to manually adding items, because the linq version caused a closure from a method it did not have context with.

### Testing
Used ILSpy to verify that the closures disappeared. (DisplayClass represents a closure)

2349421328,11478,[vs17.13] Don't mark synthesized projects dirty when SDKs define properties,surayya-MS,114938397,closed,2025-02-21T11:33:43Z,2025-02-25T12:09:55Z,2025-02-25T12:09:55Z,https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/msbuild,https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/pull/11478,"### Context
Fixes #11394
This is a regression. The bug appeared after [Expand MSBuildSdkResolver](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/45364). 

### Customer impact
Without this fix the customers that opt-into `MsBuildUseSimpleProjectRootElementCacheConcurrency` will get `System.NotImplementedException`. This includes `slngen` and `quickbuild`.

### Details
The `NotImplementedException` is thrown here:
https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/aff54559404d31214c71aa2ea6d2caa6003b0334/src/Build/Evaluation/SimpleProjectRootElementCache.cs#L133-L136
Previously the `SdkResult` of `MSBuildSdkResolver` was empty and `ProjectRootElement` was never created for it. Now, it contains 2 properties, and when `ProjectRootElement` is created, every change marks it as dirty. The fix is not to mark it dirty when it is from `SdkResult`

### Changes made
Implemented internal `CreateNotDirty` that creates `ProjectRootElement` that cannot be dirtied.

### Testing
Added unit test for `CreateNotDirty`. Also manually tested that the exception is not thrown anymore.

Risks
_Low_ - existing tests ensure that other scenarios are not broken, added new test, also tested manually this exact case.

* ``` function setArbitraryStorage(address target) external;```

### Test Cases : 
* Added test cases to verify the functionality of each cheat code.

### Desgin Choice:
* I created a separate function specifically for ``` create_bytes8 () ``` to handle the generation of an 8-byte array, instead of using a generic function for fixed-size byte arrays. This ensures better clarity and specialization for handling 8-byte arrays.Let me know if this needs to be refactored",Human,Python,949.0,94.0,https://github.com/a16z/halmos,a16z/halmos,human

It includes changes to the dev container configuration, documentation, and VS Code settings to support these servers. The most important changes are grouped into configuration updates, new features, and documentation enhancements.

### Configuration Updates:
* [`.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`](diffhunk://#diff-24ad71c8613ddcf6fd23818cb3bb477a1fb6d83af4550b0bad43099813088686L46-R46): Updated `postCreateCommand` to execute a new startup script (`.devcontainer/startup.sh`) for initializing dependencies.
* [`.vscode/mcp.json`](diffhunk://#diff-756c99ad6a15758981c15d6ba32a2d83391908e8e021f0399e9d34339dc4eadaR1-R30): Added configuration for four MCP servers (`memory`, `fetch`, `sequential-thinking`, and `file-system`) to enable their integration with GitHub Copilot Chat.
* [`.vscode/settings.json`](diffhunk://#diff-a5de3e5871ffcc383a2294845bd3df25d3eeff6c29ad46e3a396577c413bf357L3-R7): Enabled MCP-related settings (`chat.mcp.enabled` and `chat.mcp.discovery.enabled`) and changed `files.autoSave` to `afterDelay` with a 3000ms delay.

### New Features:
* [`.devcontainer/startup.sh`](diffhunk://#diff-49205b36371a0a673e7a6d64ab5b7ae5f1bdb471c54299bf63ae060d7abfac1aR1-R46): Added a startup script to initialize the development environment, including verifying Node.js, installing the `uv` package manager, and restoring .NET packages.

### Documentation Enhancements:
* [`.github/instructions/mcp-servers.md`](diffhunk://#diff-a295d407a7764901db6944f7511a09f38986db265a10e194f5f06c3bce607236R1-R191): Added detailed documentation on the configuration, usage, and verification of the four MCP servers (`memory`, `fetch`, `sequential-thinking`, and `file-system`).

### Minor Changes:
* [`.vscode/extensions.json`](diffhunk://#diff-c16655a98a3ee89a7636a59c59a72b0e93649e3a1e947327cfc43a1336b4e912L3): Removed the `codacy-app.codacy` extension from the recommended list.",Human,C#,1155.0,264.0,https://github.com/DaveSkender/Stock.Indicators,DaveSkender/Stock.Indicators,human

### Issue describing the changes in this PR

Resolves https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-core-tools/issues/4420

I'm fixing the consolidated pipeline to automatically trigger when a build is done on either the core-tools.official pipeline or the core-tools-host pipeline. However we want to distinguish between nightly builds and regular builds that were triggered by CI. Therefore, we can separate the nightly build artifacts from the CI triggered artifacts by uploading the nightly build artifacts to an internal feed.

The format of the artifact version will be: YYYY.MMDD.buildId (where MM has no leading zeros).

Here is an example of the feed:
https://azfunc.visualstudio.com/internal/_artifacts/feed/core-tools-nightly-build


This PR also conditionally downloads the artifacts from the nightly build feed in the consolidated pipeline, if the consolidated pipeline run is also only a nightly build. Otherwise, we just take whatever was triggered by CI and use that build.

Note if the consolidated pipeline is manually run, we just use whatever is the latest run (regardless of nightly build or not).

The artifacts have also been updated to being with `func` when published, such as `func-cli`

## Changes from the design approved:
- added `self` which might be a better alternative to `this`
- dropped `base` and replaced with `super`. `base` was a common name used in our operation test `op foo is base` so feels it might be as well outside.

## Behavior
Errors if used in those cases:
- declaration name
- referenced directly as a type reference
- referenced as the base reference in a member expression

- enum member name

The problem is that on OSX/ARM64, the page size is 16k (instead of the usual 4k), so `SpecialDiagInfoSize` is not a multiple of the page size, the `end` will not be page aligned.

And by the time this special region get to `CombineMemoryRegions`, it won't usually get combined with any existing region, but it itself is not page aligned, and so triggering the assertion.

We aren't really writing the actual page to the dump anyway, might as well just assert the exact size for this particular region instead.

However, initial attempts to remove it incurred large size increases on x86/x64, suggesting there was some utility in moving blocks closer to their hottest successors to keep the layout compact. To avoid derailing my consolidation plan, I've decided to refactor `fgMoveHotJumps` into a utility for 3-opt to use. For now, we will continue to use this pass to try to keep the layout compact.

/cc @vcsjones @bartonjs

## Customer Impact

- [ ] Customer reported
- [X] Found internally

This is a test-only change to react to a change in OpenSSL 3.4 that is starting to appear in our CI pipelines. OpenSSL 3.4 formats a UPN in an otherName SAN differently.

## Regression

- [ ] Yes
- [ ] No
- [X] Upstream Change

Reacting to an upstream change in OpenSSL 3.4 that was introduced here https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/de8861a7e3100053542ec020aadd3f4fc88b7a02

## Testing

Existing tests caught the change. Tests pass after conditionally handling the OpenSSL 3.4 change, so that tests will continue to pass on older OpenSSL versions, too.

## Risk

Low. Test only change.

**IMPORTANT**: If this backport is for a servicing release, please verify that:

2505203745,115375,Interpreter to JIT/AOT calls,janvorli,10758568,closed,2025-05-07T18:42:01Z,2025-05-19T12:29:04Z,2025-05-19T12:29:04Z,https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/runtime,https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/115375,"This change adds support for making calls from the interpreter to JIT/AOT generated code. For each target method, it parses the signature and creates a list of hand written asm routines that transfer the arguments from the interpreter stack to the CPU registers / stack based on the native calling convention, call the target method and then places the return value to the interpreter stack. This list is cached in the MethodDescData so that for repeated calls to the same method, it doesn't need to be re-generated.

For example, let's say that interpreter needs to call a JIT/AOT generated method with the following signature on Windows x64:
```C#
long M(int a, int b, long c, double d)
```
The interpreter stack stores these arguments aligned to 8 byte slots like this:

```
Slot 0: a
Slot 1: b
Slot 2: c
Slot 3: d
```
The `CallStubGenerator::GenerateCallStub` would then generate the following list of routines:
```
Load_RCX_RDX_R8
Load_XMM3
<target method address>
```

* The interpreter calls the `CallJittedMethodRetI8` function, because the return type is long. The arguments passed to this function are the list of routines above, pointer to slot 0 mentioned above, pointer to the return value slot on the interpreter stack and the size of the stack arguments the target method uses (0 in this case, as all arguments are passed in registers).
* The `CallJittedMethodRetI8` calls the first routine in the list
* The `Load_RCX_RDX_R8` loads RCX from slot 0, RDX from slot 1, R8 from slot 2 and then jumps to the next routine, which is the `Load_XMM3`
* The `Load_XMM3` loads XMM3 from the slot 3 and jumps to the next routine, which is the target method
* After the target method returns, the control flow gets back to the `CallJittedMethodRetI8`. That function stores the RAX that contains the result to the return value slot on the interpreter stack and returns back to the interpreter.",Human,C#,17286.0,5274.0,https://github.com/dotnet/runtime,dotnet/runtime,human

### Context
Unix only.
`HttpListenerContext` is not released from `Dictionary<HttpListenerContext, HttpListenerContext> _listenerContexts` when code is written by best and documented practices. Cleaning is done by disposing websocket instance but websocket does not close connection, which is needed to properly cleanup.
This is causing HttpListenerContext piling in `_listenerContexts` resulting in memory leak.

See #101022 for more details.

### Code changes
I have not found other solution than wrapping websocket into private class `HttpListenerWrappedWebSocket` along with needed objects to cleanup connection at websocket Dispose.

### Testing
I have verified that my mini repro (client and sever consoles) no longer reproes after give changes been compiled into experimental dotnet Runtime.",Human,C#,17286.0,5274.0,https://github.com/dotnet/runtime,dotnet/runtime,human

2266772678,10129,.Net: Add a request index to the streamed function call update content,SergeyMenshykh,68852919,closed,2025-01-08T18:19:23Z,2025-01-14T11:20:18Z,2025-01-14T11:20:18Z,https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/semantic-kernel,https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel/pull/10129,"### Motivation and Context: 
Today, it's impossible to determine which request a streaming function call update belongs to or originates from. As a result, if an AI service interaction leads to multiple requests to an AI model - let's say one per function call - it's impossible to assemble the function call contents from the streamed updates. This is because the streaming function call updates from the second request override those from the first one.

### Description
This PR adds the `RequestIndex` to the `StreamingFunctionCallUpdateContent` class and updates the {Azure}OpenAI connectors to set it.

2480374342,10077,[XABT] Separate marshal method storage from `MarshalMethodClassifier` to `MarshalMethodsCollection`.,jpobst,179295,closed,2025-04-24T23:49:01Z,2025-05-01T17:45:35Z,2025-05-01T17:45:35Z,https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/android,https://github.com/dotnet/android/pull/10077,"Today the marshal method scanning process is tightly coupled to scanning for JavaCallableWrappers. That is, when building `CallableWrapperType` objects, the `MarshalMethodsClassifier` is used to classify methods as marshal methods by calling `ShouldBeDynamicallyRegistered (...)`.

However `ShouldBeDynamicallyRegistered` doesn't just return a simple `bool`, it has the side effect of building a list of `MarshalMethodEntry` objects that are used extensively throughout the build process.

We are likely going to need to build this list in places other than JavaCallableWrappers scanning: assembly rewriting will likely be before JCWs, and `GenerateNativeMarshalMethodSources` will likely be after JCWs.

As such:
- Rework `MarshalMethodsClassifier` to simply classify methods as LLVM marshal method eligible or not (dynamically registered).
- Move storage to a new `MarshalMethodsCollection`.

Additionally, rework `MarshalMethodsClassifier` to also be able to detect marshal methods that have already been rewritten and provide the information later steps (`GenerateJavaStubs`, `GenerateNativeMarshalMethodSources`) need to function properly.  This isn't in use yet, but will be needed in the future.",Human,C#,2082.0,564.0,https://github.com/dotnet/android,dotnet/android,human
2341498446,9805,[Experimental] Add alternative way of resolving UCO function pointers for Marshal Methods,simonrozsival,374616,closed,2025-02-18T09:26:40Z,2025-02-28T20:01:38Z,2025-02-28T20:01:38Z,https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/android,https://github.com/dotnet/android/pull/9805,"This PR aims at creating an alternative to the current implementation of `MonodroidRuntime::get_function_pointer` which does not use Mono embedding APIs. It is inspired by what xamarin/xamarin-macios does in its ""ManagedStaticRegistrar"".

The way this alternative function pointer lookup method works is that it generates IL of several lookup tables as part of `MarshalMethodsAssemblyRewriter`.

Each UCO method is given three indexes: `(uint assemblyIndex, uint classIndex, uint methodIndex)`. These values are later baked into the generated LLVM IR code in `MarshalMethodsNativeAssemblyGenerator`.

The indexes are used in three different switches generated in different parts of the app:
1. `GetFunctionPointer(int methodIndex)` method is added to each class which has marshal methods UCOs
    - The method contains a simple switch over `methodIndex` and returns the unamanged function pointer to the given UCO.
    - Low risk: Possible collision with existing methods in customer code. Possible resolution would be to make the method name more unique, such as `__GetFunctionPointer__`.
2. `Java.Interop.__ManagedMarshalMethodsLookupTable__` public class with the `GetFunctionPointer(int classIndex, int methodIndex)` is added to each assembly which contains classes with marshal methods
    - The method contains a simple switch over `cassIndex` and calls methods from (1).
    - Special care is given to calling `GetFunctionPointer(int methodIndex)` on private nested classes (and also protected and private protected). These methods cannot be called directly due to visibility constraint, so additional proxy method(s) are added to their parent class(es) to forward the calls to the nested classes.
    - If there are too many classes form a given assembly with UCOs, this switch might be too long for JIT to compile. To solve this problem, we would need to split the method into several smaller ones, as described in https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-macios/blob/main/docs/managed-static-registrar.md#method-mapping. I have not implemented this yet, since I am not convinced we will run into the same problem as on iOS, where the UCO methods each have just a single `int` index and are initially part of one huge switch statement, while we are already splitting the lookup into three levels by the assembly and class.
3. `Java.Interop.ManagedMarshalMethodsLookupTable.GetFunctionPointer(int assemblyIndex, int classIndex, int methodIndex)` in `Mono.Android` is overwritten:
    - The method contains a simple switch over `assemblyIndex` and calls methods from (2).

The ""type mapping"" part (parts 2 and 3) should later be replaced by a trimmable solution based on https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/110691

This alternative lookup can be enabled by setting `$(_AndroidUseManagedMarshalMethodsLookup)=true` alongside with `$(AndroidEnableMarshalMethods)=true`. It is off by default for Mono and it should be turned on by default with other runtimes when marshal methods are also enabled since they don't have Mono embedding APIs.

When testing with Mono, I saw very similar performance as the existing `get_function_pointer` method has. The managed implementation was almost as fast (on emulator: median 77μs vs 73μs, average 158μs vs 114μs), but I am not confident I did the meassurements the right way (I just used chrono high_resolution_clock). If performance of this feature is a concern in the comments, I will figure out the proper way to do the meassurements).

I am not set on the naming of the feature. Feedback is very welcome.

2379223800,9893,﻿[XABT] Scan for JLO needed wrappers in `LinkAssembliesNoShrink`.,jpobst,179295,closed,2025-03-07T18:39:02Z,2025-03-18T18:28:17Z,2025-03-18T18:28:17Z,https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/android,https://github.com/dotnet/android/pull/9893,"Today, application builds use Cecil to scan through all Android assemblies at least twice:

- Debug: `_LinkAssembliesNoShrink`, `_GenerateJavaStubs`
- Release: `_ILLink`, `_GenerateJavaStubs`, `_RemoveRegisterAttribute`

This is a costly operation that we would like to only perform once to help speed up application builds.  The long-term goal is to move the (many) steps currently performed by `_GenerateJavaStubs` into ""linker"" steps.

This PR moves the Cecil scanning required for the first step: ""generating Java Callable Wrappers"".

## Implementation

This does not move generating JCW Java code to the linker, it only moves scanning for the JLO information needed to generate JCWs to the linker.  This information is persisted as an XML file in `/obj` next to the processed assembly.

Example:

- `obj/Debug/net10.0-android/android/assets/MyApplication.dll`
- `obj/Debug/net10.0-android/android/assets/MyApplication.jlo.xml`

Doing it this way has two benefits: it helps keep the linker from getting too complex (eg: generating Java code) and it helps incremental builds.  If an assembly has not changed since the last build, the JLO information in the `.jlo.xml` is still valid and will be reused.  The assembly does not need to be re-scanned.  (For example, the ~70 AndroidX assemblies that the MAUI template uses do not need to be re-scanned on every Debug build.)

The process of actually generating the JCWs is done by a new `GenerateJavaCallableWrappers` task in the `_GenerateJavaStubs` target that consumes the `.jlo.xml` files and outputs the `.java` files.

## Release Builds

In an ideal Release build, we would (probably?) run this new step as part of the `ILLink` invocation.  However there are some tricky limitations to running in the linker pipeline, chiefly being that the linker cannot load external assemblies like `Java.Interop.Tool.JavaCallableWrappers.dll` (and dependencies) that we need.  This can be worked around by including the needed source files in the linker assembly, but this will require additional work.

Instead, for now, we will add an invocation a new `_LinkAssembliesAdditionalSteps` target to linked builds that runs after `ILLink`. This calls the existing `LinkAssembliesNoShrink` task to scan for JLOs but does not execute the other linker tasks that have already been run. This allows us to move forward with converting to ""linker steps"" for making Debug builds faster without the extra work required to move these steps into `ILLink`.  A future enhancement can perform this work if desired.  (There is also [some question](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/107211) as to whether we actually want to create new `ILLink` linker steps.)

Note this temporarily leaves the `$(_AndroidJLOCheckedBuild)` flag that compares the generated Java files to the previous ones.  This will likely be useful ensuring future moved steps are correct as well.",Human,C#,2082.0,564.0,https://github.com/dotnet/android,dotnet/android,human
2404898126,9940,[ci] Don't re-run `dotnet test` if there are no auto retry tests.,jpobst,179295,closed,2025-03-19T20:04:03Z,2025-03-20T17:54:54Z,2025-03-20T17:54:53Z,https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/android,https://github.com/dotnet/android/pull/9940,"Context: https://github.com/dotnet/android/commit/d00b779a5b5f405af967d85e28e570e873631a6b

Commit https://github.com/dotnet/android/commit/d00b779a5b5f405af967d85e28e570e873631a6b added a unit test retry mechanism to address flaky emulator tests.  

This works by:

- Running the unit tests via `dotnet test`
- Running `dotnet-test-slicer` to create a test filter that only contains the failed tests
- Rerunning `dotnet test` with the filtered test list

In the case where there are no failed tests, a ""dummy"" filter is created that does not match any tests.

Most of the time this is fine and the `dotnet test` invocation with the dummy filter takes a couple of seconds to determine it has nothing to do and exits.  However, this ***no-op*** can ***itself*** hang, causing the build to hang for ~3 hours and eventually fail.  🤦 

Instead, add a check to see if the failed test list is empty and fully skip the `dotnet test` invocation if it is, avoiding the potential hang.

2472212399,10058,[XABT] GeneratePackageManagerJava - Convert `NativeCodeGenState` to Cecil-less DTOs.,jpobst,179295,closed,2025-04-21T23:27:19Z,2025-04-23T20:38:45Z,2025-04-23T20:38:45Z,https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/android,https://github.com/dotnet/android/pull/10058,"Context: https://github.com/dotnet/android/issues/10062

_One_ issue with our desire to move around LLVM Marshal Method build code so that it can work with Ready2Run is that our current implementation relies on holding Cecil `AssemblyDefinition` objects open in global state across multiple targets.  While these objects are open, no other process can access our assemblies, making it harder to reorder targets and tasks.

As a first step towards refactoring this process, let's move the data into a DTO that does not require Cecil.  Additionally, this makes it clear _what_ data is actually consumed by `<GeneratePackageManagerJava>` rather than ""entire assemblies"" so we can focus on how to properly obtain and persist the data.

This still relies on `BuildEngine4.RegisterTaskObject` to store the data, but a likely future step would be to persist it to a file instead.",Human,C#,2082.0,564.0,https://github.com/dotnet/android,dotnet/android,human

2348525274,10870,Add Response compression support,kshyju,144469,closed,2025-02-21T02:49:58Z,2025-02-26T21:14:53Z,2025-02-26T21:14:53Z,https://api.github.com/repos/Azure/azure-functions-host,https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-host/pull/10870,"resolves #7285

Currently, response compression is enabled on platform level for app service windows because Windows workers still use IIS. For Linux use case, Kestrel serves as the web server. This PR adds support for enabling response compression on host by leveraging the ASP.NET response compression middleware. Customers can opt in by setting the feature flag **""EnableResponseCompression""** to enable this behavior.

2555717990,79,Support for etl files generated by pktmon,grcusanz,16003278,closed,2025-05-30T21:17:14Z,2025-06-04T22:36:42Z,2025-06-04T22:36:42Z,https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/etl2pcapng,https://github.com/microsoft/etl2pcapng/pull/79,"This PR adds support for etl files generated by pktmon.  See updated readme for more info.  Additional details below:  

**Interface description block usage:**
1. Add one interface description block for each component that is used by a packet.  These are added in the order they appear in the pktmon etl file and are automatically assigned a new Id based on that index.  The original Component Id is not preserved as there is no field for it in pcapng.

   Unused components in the pktmon etl file are not added as interfaces to the pcapng file.

2. In the interface description block populate the following option fields:

   | Interface Description Block | Pktmon source |
   |---|---|
   | Name | “Name” property from Component Description event 20 |
   |Description|“Description” property from Component Description event 20 |
   |Option 4 – IPv4 Address|“IpAddress” property from Component IPv4 event 65 for components that have this event. |
   |Option 5 – IPv6 Address|“IpAddress” property from Component IPv6 event 66 for components that have this event. |
   |Option 6 – Mac Address|“Value” property from Component HWAddr Event 70 for components that have this event. |

**Enhanced Packet Block usage:**
1. Interface ID updated to refer to correct Interface Description Block index for the component.
2. Process ID and Thread ID will not be written to comment options for pktmon packets as this bloats the file significantly, and instead when non-zero will be output to the appropriate option below.
3. In the Enhanced Packet Block the following options will now be set:

   | Enhanced Packet Block | Pktmon source   |
   |---|---|
   | PacketLength|“OriginalPayloadSize” from packet events 160 and 170. |
   | CapturedLength|“LoggedPayloadSize” from Packet events 160 and 170 |
   | Payload|“Payload” from Packet events 160 and 170 |
   | Option 5 – Packet Id | “PktGroupId” from Packet event 160.  Note: pktmon maintains a pktgroupid and a packetid.  Pktgroupid remains consistent even if a packet is fragmented into multiple packets, which would each get assigned a new packet id.  Unfortunately pcapng only has one packetid field, so I’ve chosen to use pktgroupid to preserve the original association between appearances. |
   | Option 7 – Verdict; VerdictType = XDP (2); Verdict = XDP_DROP (1) | For recording packet that are dropped as reported by Packet Drop event 170.  pcapng doesn’t have a generic verdict type for reporting drops and XDP_DROP appears to be the best fit for our use case. |
   | Option 8 – Process; ProcessID and ThreadId | Process ID and Thread ID are set if the packet event contains a non-zero Process ID. |

**Systemd Journal Export Block usage:**
Although named for systemd events, the structure of this block is flexible enough to map the necessary message information from a Windows event.   We will utilize this block for any non-zero event id that is not custom processed as a netsh, vswitch, ras or pktmon event.
In the Systemd journal payload we will only populate the following fields:
|Systemd Journal field | Pktmon etl source|
|---|---|
|__REALTIME_TIMESTAMP (REQUIRED)|Timestamp from the event.|
|_COMM|Provider name contained in the message.  Example: Microsoft-Windows-TCPIP|
|MESSAGE|The formatted message as generated from TdhGetEventInformation, and TdhGetEventMapInformation.|

* Move all SNI files to the common project
* Suffix all managed SNI files with "".netcore""
* Wrap all files in #if NET
* Rename SNI namespace to ManagedSni - I feel there's a good chance we can (and should) separate native SNI implementation into its own namespace as well, so having this separation will be useful

A great security feature that prevents certain exploits.

* Set Intel's Control-flow Enforcement Technology to explicitly enabled in the project.

* The Native Ahead-Of-Time compilation now favors execution speed and performance over package size. (Will be monitoring this one as the app gets bigger when more features are implemented in the future. For now, it only increases the package size by 1MB)

* Enabled a new code analyzer to enforce more code best practices: `dotnet_diagnostic.CA1724`. (Type names should not match namespaces)

* Updated the [AppControl Manager document](https://github.com/HotCakeX/Harden-Windows-Security/wiki/AppControl-Manager).

* Formatted all XAML codes for better readability.

* Adjusted the App Control Simulation code based on the custom serialization/deserialization logic introduced in the previous update.

* Updated `Microsoft.IdentityModel.Abstractions` NuGet dependency.

* Aligned some columns in the new ListViews.

* Added a new message bar to the [Create Policy From Event Logs](https://github.com/HotCakeX/Harden-Windows-Security/wiki/Create-Policy-From-Event-Logs) to show real time messages about the currently running processes.

* Added a new button called `Only Use Selected Items` to the [Create Policy From Event Logs](https://github.com/HotCakeX/Harden-Windows-Security/wiki/Create-Policy-From-Event-Logs) and [Create Policy From MDE Advanced Hunting](https://github.com/HotCakeX/Harden-Windows-Security/wiki/Create-Policy-From-MDE-Advanced-Hunting) pages. The following is the description of the button:

  * Only include the selected items in the supplemental policy. You can select one or more items in the ListView and if this option is enabled, only those will be included in the supplemental policy. If this is disabled, everything will be included in the supplemental policy. If you use this option and nothing is selected in the ListView, everything will be included in the supplemental policy.

* Added a Progress Ring to the [Policy Editor](https://github.com/HotCakeX/Harden-Windows-Security/wiki/PolicyEditor) page to show the progress when a policy is being loaded.

* Added additional helpful insights to many UI elements for accessibility purposes so tools such as screen readers will be able to use them to generate proper feedback for people that need them.

* Added more messages to the message bar in the [Create Policy From MDE Advanced Hunting](https://github.com/HotCakeX/Harden-Windows-Security/wiki/Create-Policy-From-MDE-Advanced-Hunting) page. They offer more information about the current operation and its progress.

* Added a button called `Open In The Policy Editor` to the following pages:

  * [Create AppControl Policy](https://github.com/HotCakeX/Harden-Windows-Security/wiki/Create-App-Control-Policy)

  * [Allow New Apps](https://github.com/HotCakeX/Harden-Windows-Security/wiki/Allow-New-Apps)

  * [Create Policy From MDE Advanced Hunting](https://github.com/HotCakeX/Harden-Windows-Security/wiki/Create-Policy-From-MDE-Advanced-Hunting)


This feature enables users to seamlessly open newly created policies directly in the [Policy Editor](https://github.com/HotCakeX/Harden-Windows-Security/wiki/PolicyEditor), offering a detailed overview of the policy, its associated rules, and the ability to refine and customize it further. By streamlining this workflow, the feature significantly reduces friction and enhances the overall user experience. **The button only appears at the end of the operation on the message bars of each section.**

Updates `ossf/scorecard-action` from 2.4.0 to 2.4.1

<h2>v2.4.1</h2>
<h2>What's Changed</h2>
<ul>
<li>This update bumps the Scorecard version to the v5.1.1 release. For a complete list of changes, please refer to the <a href=""https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/releases/tag/v5.1.0"">v5.1.0</a> and <a href=""https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/releases/tag/v5.1.1"">v5.1.1</a> release notes.</li>
<li>Publishing results now uses half the API quota as before. The exact savings depends on the repository in question.
<ul>
<li>use Scorecard library entrypoint instead of Cobra hooking by <a href=""https://github.com/spencerschrock""><code>@​spencerschrock</code></a> in <a href=""https://redirect.github.com/ossf/scorecard-action/pull/1423"">ossf/scorecard-action#1423</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Some errors were made into annotations to make them more visible
<ul>
<li>Make default branch error more prominent by <a href=""https://github.com/jsoref""><code>@​jsoref</code></a> in <a href=""https://redirect.github.com/ossf/scorecard-action/pull/1459"">ossf/scorecard-action#1459</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There is now an optional <code>file_mode</code> input which controls how repository files are fetched from GitHub. The default is <code>archive</code>, but <code>git</code> produces the most accurate results for repositories with <code>.gitattributes</code> files at the cost of analysis speed.
<ul>
<li>add input for specifying <code>--file-mode</code> by <a href=""https://github.com/spencerschrock""><code>@​spencerschrock</code></a> in <a href=""https://redirect.github.com/ossf/scorecard-action/pull/1509"">ossf/scorecard-action#1509</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The underlying container for the action is now <a href=""https://github.com/ossf/scorecard-action/pkgs/container/scorecard-action"">hosted on GitHub Container Registry</a>. There should be no functional changes.
<ul>
<li>:seedling: publish docker images to GitHub Container Registry by <a href=""https://github.com/spencerschrock""><code>@​spencerschrock</code></a> in <a href=""https://redirect.github.com/ossf/scorecard-action/pull/1453"">ossf/scorecard-action#1453</a></li>

2402287804,7426,Reduce usage of unsafe constructs throughout codebase,GrabYourPitchforks,1746272,closed,2025-03-18T23:25:47Z,2025-03-20T15:41:16Z,2025-03-20T15:41:16Z,https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/machinelearning,https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/pull/7426,"This reduces the use of raw pointers and replaces them with safer constructs where possible. In some cases, `MemoryMarshal.Read<T>`, `MemoryMarshal.Write<T>`, and `MemoryMarshal.AsBytes<T>` are used.

Though these three methods are normally unsafe-equivalent APIs, they are guaranteed safe when _T_ is a primitive integral or floating point type, char, or an enum thereof. (That is, it's guaranteed safe when _T_ is byte, sbyte, short, ushort, char, int, uint, long, ulong, int128, uint128, nint, nuint, float, double, Half, or an enum of any of these.)

I've left code comments where things couldn't be made fully safe. I've also opted _not_ to touch some code in VectorUtils.cs. I only touched code where the loop logic is simple enough for the JIT (even the older netfx JIT!) to always elide bounds checks. I didn't touch code paths where multiple buffers were being touched at once since the JIT doesn't yet properly elide bounds checks in those cases, and I didn't want to risk a possible perf regression.",Human,C#,9303.0,1938.0,https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning,dotnet/machinelearning,human
2402191581,7425,Support ByteLevel encoding in Bpe tokenizer to support DeepSeek model,tarekgh,10833894,closed,2025-03-18T21:50:59Z,2025-03-19T20:50:54Z,2025-03-19T20:50:54Z,https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/machinelearning,https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/pull/7425,"This change includes:  

- Adding support for **ByteLevel encoding** in the BPE tokenizer.  
- Introducing a new `BpeTokenizer.Create` method that allows creating a tokenizer using the newly introduced `BpeOptions` type. This enables users to obtain tokenizer data from various sources (e.g., `tokenizer.json` files) and instantiate the tokenizer using this new factory method.  
- Expanding test coverage to validate ByteLevel support.  
- Adding a test that loads the real [tokenizer.json](https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1/blob/main/tokenizer.json) for the **DeepSeek R1** model and verifies its functionality. Since the DeepSeek tokenizer utilizes ByteLevel encoding, it serves as an ideal test case for this feature.  
- Providing test code for loading `tokenizer.json`, which can be used as a template for loading other models' tokenizers when needed.
- Introducing the CompositePreTokenizer to support the DeepSeek pre-tokenization scenario.",Human,C#,9303.0,1938.0,https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning,dotnet/machinelearning,human

<h2><a href=""https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/compare/v5.2.0...v6.0.0"">5.2.1</a> (2025-03-26)</h2>
<h3>Security</h3>
<ul>
<li>cross-origin requests are not allowed unless allowed by <code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</code> header</li>
<li>requests with an IP addresses in the <code>Origin</code> header are not allowed to connect to WebSocket server unless configured by <code>allowedHosts</code> or it different from the <code>Host</code> header</li>
</ul>
<p>The above changes may make the dev server not work if you relied on such behavior, but unfortunately they carry security risks, so they were considered as fixes.</p>
<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
<ul>
<li>prevent overlay for errors caught by React error boundaries (<a href=""https://redirect.github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/issues/5431"">#5431</a>) (<a href=""https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/commit/8c1abc903ab444d9ce99e567b9a6c603e1ec06be"">8c1abc9</a>)</li>
<li>take the first network found instead of the last one, this restores the same behavior as 5.0.4 (<a href=""https://redirect.github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/issues/5411"">#5411</a>) (<a href=""https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/commit/ffd0b86b790d372f90e17aea92cfd9def83fee96"">ffd0b86</a>)</li>

<li>added <code>getClientEntry</code> and <code>getClientHotEntry</code> methods to get clients entries (<a href=""https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/commit/dc642a832d45c23c5c7a08fbf29995e0db7e0d95"">dc642a8</a>)</li>

<h3>Security</h3>
<ul>
<li>cross-origin requests are not allowed unless allowed by <code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</code> header</li>
<li>requests with an IP addresses in the <code>Origin</code> header are not allowed to connect to WebSocket server unless configured by <code>allowedHosts</code> or it different from the <code>Host</code> header</li>
</ul>
<p>The above changes may make the dev server not work if you relied on such behavior, but unfortunately they carry security risks, so they were considered as fixes.</p>
<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
<ul>
<li>prevent overlay for errors caught by React error boundaries (<a href=""https://redirect.github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/issues/5431"">#5431</a>) (<a href=""https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/commit/8c1abc903ab444d9ce99e567b9a6c603e1ec06be"">8c1abc9</a>)</li>
<li>take the first network found instead of the last one, this restores the same behavior as 5.0.4 (<a href=""https://redirect.github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/issues/5411"">#5411</a>) (<a href=""https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/commit/ffd0b86b790d372f90e17aea92cfd9def83fee96"">ffd0b86</a>)</li>

<h3>Security</h3>
<ul>
<li>cross-origin requests are not allowed unless allowed by <code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</code> header</li>
<li>requests with an IP addresses in the <code>Origin</code> header are not allowed to connect to WebSocket server unless configured by <code>allowedHosts</code> or it different from the <code>Host</code> header</li>

2393530051,1777,Fix incorrect end predicate in Sliced iterator's second constructor,alimansour0002,106339946,closed,2025-03-14T12:21:02Z,2025-03-16T05:04:33Z,2025-03-16T05:04:33Z,https://api.github.com/repos/yegor256/cactoos,https://github.com/yegor256/cactoos/pull/1777,"## Description
This PR fixes an issue with the `Sliced` iterator class where the second constructor was using an incorrect end predicate.

### Problem
The current implementation uses `any -> !iterator.hasNext()` which captures the iterator's state at construction time. This creates a fixed boolean value that doesn't change when the actual `hasNext()` method is called later, leading to incorrect iteration behavior.

### Solution
Changed the predicate to `any -> false` which means ""never end because of the predicate"". The actual end condition is properly checked in the `hasNext()` method with `this.iterator.hasNext()`.

Some memories couldn't be reset due to their reliance on relative external sources like `PDFKnowledge`. This was caused by the need to run the reset memories command from the `src` directory, which could break when external files weren't accessible from that path.

This commit allows the reset command to be executed from the root of the project — the same location typically used to run a crew — improving compatibility and reducing friction.

## Description

This PR improves the handling of streaming responses from LLMs in the CrewAI framework, addressing issues with empty responses and enhancing error handling. The changes include:

### Core Improvements
- Enhanced the `_handle_streaming_response` method to properly extract content from various chunk formats
- Added robust error handling for streaming responses with fallback to non-streaming
- Implemented proper handling of empty responses with appropriate default messages
- Added support for tool calling in streaming mode

### Event System Enhancements
- Added `LLMStreamChunkEvent` to the event system to track streaming chunks
- Updated the event listener to handle streaming events
- Updated documentation to include information about the new event type

### Testing
- Added comprehensive tests for streaming functionality:
  - Basic streaming response handling
  - Tool calling with streaming enabled
  - Fallback mechanism when streaming fails

Treat 'falsy' issue while setting context to a Task

----

Currently, the `Task.context` is other tasks whose outputs will be used as context for the task. The default value is None which is a 'falsy' Python value. 
For a Crew `None` means: get the context from all previous tasks outputs. This creates a limitation, because we currently have no way to explicitly say, “this task should have no additional context.

This PR address this issue by allowing us to set empty value in a Task's context. From now on, any falsy Python value (like `None`, `[]`, or `False`) will be treated as ""no context should be used"" for the task",Human,Python,41665.0,5580.0,https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI,crewAIInc/crewAI,human

The changes include:

1. **Streaming Tool Call Support**:
   - Enhanced the `_handle_streaming_tool_calls` method to properly handle streaming tool calls
   - Added support for accumulating tool arguments and emit events during streaming

2. **Testing**:
   - Replace pytest-vcr by pytest-recording to allow recording cassettes from streaming responses
   - Remove @skip_streaming_in_ci because we are able handle those response properly

This PR would help improve the reliability and type safety of the LLM implementation while adding support for streaming tool calls, which is an important feature for real-time AI interactions.

1. Support for isolated memory configuration
   - Users can now define individual memory types independently. This change makes it easier to use a specific memory type without unintentionally enabling all others. Previously, setting memory=True would implicitly configure all available memories (like LTM and STM), which might not be ideal in all cases. 
   For example, when building a chatbot that only needs an external memory, users were forced to also configure LTM and STM — which rely on default OpenAPI embeddings — even if they weren’t needed. 
   With this update, users can now define a single memory in isolation, making the configuration process simpler and more flexible.

2. Enhanced memory documentation
   - Improved documentation for memory system usage and configuration
   - Better clarity on memory types and their interactions

3. Warning system for memory configuration
   - Added warning when long-term memory is enabled without entity memory
   - Helps users avoid potential memory configuration issues",Human,Python,41665.0,5580.0,https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI,crewAIInc/crewAI,human
2391170156,2363,docs: add instructions for upgrading crewAI with uv tool,tonykipkemboi,64493665,closed,2025-03-13T14:35:33Z,2025-03-13T14:38:33Z,2025-03-13T14:38:33Z,https://api.github.com/repos/crewAIInc/crewAI,https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/2363,"## Description

This PR makes two important updates to the installation documentation:

1. Fixes a typo in the command: changed `uv tools list` to the correct command `uv tool list`

2. Adds instructions for upgrading crewAI using `uv tool install crewai --upgrade`

## Why this is important

When trying to upgrade crewAI using `uv tool upgrade crewai` (even with the `--upgrade` flag), the command doesn't actually upgrade to the latest version and shows ""Nothing to upgrade"" even when a newer version is available.

Through testing, I discovered that the proper way to upgrade packages with uv is to use `uv tool install [package] --upgrade` instead. This successfully upgraded crewAI from version 0.100.0 to 0.105.0 in my testing.

This documentation update will help users correctly upgrade their crewAI installation when new versions are released.

- We are not properly handling the issue when LiteLLM fails to make a call because it doesn't have the proper API keys.
- As a result, the crew tries to make the same llm call until we hit the max iteration limit (20 by default).

Issues for users:
- To the users, it looks like crew is broken and not making progress. Checkout this issue: https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/1934

Solution:
- We properly handle LiteLLM exceptions now and exit early.

This PR doesn’t address all flakiness but introduces some packages to help simulate more deterministic behavior in the future. 

The flakiness issues addressed were:

**fix: prevent crash when event handler raises exception** 
> Previously, if a registered event handler raised an exception during execution,
it could crash the entire application or interrupt the event dispatch process.
This change wraps handler execution in a try/except block within the `emit` method,
ensuring that exceptions are caught and logged without affecting other handlers or flow.
This improves the resilience of the event bus, especially when handling third-party
or temporary listeners.

**test: fix flaky test ValueError: Circular reference detected**
> We need to be cautious when assigning values in the test file, as doing so makes them available in the entire module. For this case, we were facing a circular reference issue when copying Agent instances.. after debugging I noticed that the GC was detecting many Agent attributes twice. To handle it properly within tests I used pytest.fixture for a better scope control

Co-Authored-By: @Rolando-B

## Issue
The previous enhancement PR #147 inadvertently removed crucial search localization parameters (`country`, `location`, `locale`) from the `SerperDevTool` class. These parameters are essential for users who need to perform geographically targeted searches.

## Changes
- Restored the following parameters to `SerperDevTool`:
  - `country` (maps to `gl` in Serper API)
  - `location` (for city-specific searches)
  - `locale` (maps to `hl` in Serper API)
- Updated payload construction in `_make_api_request` to include these parameters
- Updated usage examples to demonstrate localization parameters

## Why
These parameters are crucial for:
1. Getting region-specific search results (via `country`)
2. Targeting searches to specific cities (via `location`)
3. Getting results in specific languages (via `locale`)

The agent uses the tool description to decide what to propagate when a tool with **kwargs is found, but this often leads to failures during the tool invocation step.

This happens because the final description ends up like this:

```
CrewStructuredTool(name='Knowledge base', description='Tool Name: Knowledge base
Tool Arguments: {'query': {'description': None, 'type': 'str'}, 'kwargs': {'description': None, 'type': 'Any'}}
Tool Description: A knowledge base that can be used to answer questions.')
```

The agent then tries to infer and pass a kwargs parameter, which isn’t supported by the schema at all.

## Addressed issues

- Remove **kwargs from most RagTool classes: this should help the Agent make better decisions when calling a search Tool.
- Ensure proper configuration when using add: according to the documentation, some search methods must be defined as either a loader or a data_type. This commit ensures that.
- Fix GitHubSearch integration: the current integration was not working properly.

> Well, I tried a lot of packages, actually.. but every package added to much complexity on Tool usage. My goal is to keep the experience feeling 'magical' while still ensuring security and transparency.
So I’d rather go with a simpler approach by just limiting and blocking certain things


**Description**

This pull request introduces significant enhancements to the way Python code is executed, with a strong emphasis on **security**, **transparency**, and **flexibility**.

### Secure Sandbox Mode
- Implemented a **restricted execution environment** to prevent unsafe code from affecting the host system.
- Blocked access to dangerous built-ins and sensitive modules (`os`, `sys`, `subprocess`, etc.).
- Custom `__import__` logic ensures only allowed modules can be used.
- Designed to safely execute user or AI-generated code with minimal risk.

### Improved Logging and Visual Feedback
- Added a `Printer` utility for clear, colored console output.
- Users now see which **execution mode** is active (safe/restricted/unsafe).
- Explicit warnings are shown when running code in unsafe mode.

Adds top level functions

 - `@app.fn` (but maybe `app.function` is better) to wrap functions, register them but leave them directly exposed
 - Serialize to `@app.fn` if there are no dependencies
 
 Just an intro PR for #2293

For completion of 2293, I think out standing changes are:
 - [ ] some UI aspect (maybe a new language toggle?)
 - [ ] Top level imports
 - [ ] Looser requirements for serialization (can use imports and other app.fns)

But this is hidden under `App(_toplevel_fn=True)`

## 🔍 Description of Changes

```python
@app.fn
def self_ref_fib(n: int) -> int:
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    return self_ref_fib(n - 1) + self_ref_fib(n - 2)

##### Suggest `@vitejs/plugin-react-oxc` if rolldown-vite is detected [#&#8203;491](https://redirect.github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/pull/491)

Emit a log which recommends `@vitejs/plugin-react-oxc` when `rolldown-vite` is detected to improve performance and use Oxc under the hood. The warning can be disabled by setting `disableOxcRecommendation: false` in the plugin options.

##### Use `optimizeDeps.rollupOptions` instead of `optimizeDeps.esbuildOptions` for rolldown-vite [#&#8203;489](https://redirect.github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/pull/489)

This suppresses the warning about `optimizeDeps.esbuildOptions` being deprecated in rolldown-vite.

##### Add Vite 7-beta to peerDependencies range [#&#8203;497](https://redirect.github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/pull/497)

React plugins are compatible with Vite 7, this removes the warning when testing the beta.

##### Add explicit semicolon in preambleCode [#&#8203;485](https://redirect.github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/pull/485)

Previously, code editor would not refresh when you pass a new value, which I'm not sure is intentional. If this is a breaking change, maybe we can introduce a new argument.

Try:
```python
mo.ui.code_editor(value=""HELLO"")
```
Then, change to:
```python
mo.ui.code_editor(value=""HIYA"")
```
The output will still be the old value of HELLO.

quarto `0.14.7` is broken.

I'm having trouble confirming this is the issue by replicating it locally, since I can't replicate the breakage. My dev served assets seem to work in general. But `being islands` != `being wasm` as is, and I think some of the logic around sockets gets lost (0.14.6 works, so this may be the offending PR: #5403)

Fix #5395 

## 🔍 Description of Changes

Both copy path options in the file explorer's (View File sidebar panel) context menu were returning the same absolute path on Windows systems. The relative path should show only the portion relative to the workspace root, not the full/absolute path.

Fixed by replacing the slash logic with a new `withTrailingDelimiter` method that uses the existing `PathBuilder.deliminator` to append the correct path separator accordingly.

Added tests covering both Unix and Windows path scenarios.

**Before**: Both options returned `D:\full\path\to\file.py`  
**After**: Copy Path returns `D:\full\path\to\file.py`, Copy Relative Path returns `subfolder\file.py`

- Move `instantly_payable_unpaid_balance*` methods from the main User model into the `User::MoneyBalance` concern, next to the `unpaid_balance*` methods
- Rename `instantly_payable_unpaid_balance*` methods to have symmetry with the existing `upaid_balance*` methods
- Move the instant payout min/max constants to the `StripePaymentProcessor` (since they are Stripe-specific limits)
  - `MINIMUM_INSTANT_PAYOUT_AMOUNT_CENTS`
  - `MAXIMUM_INSTANT_PAYOUT_AMOUNT_CENTS`
- Update specs / VCR recordings to reference new method locations

> Note: This PR does not change any functionality.

### Why

Instant payments should be as symmetrical to standard payments as possible. These methods were already related to the existing functionality in `User::MoneyBalance`.

These changes make the daily payouts PR more readable, and clarify what are functional vs. non-functional changes.",Human,Ruby,7803.0,1470.0,https://github.com/antiwork/gumroad,antiwork/gumroad,human

# Skip payout pause for sellers with accounts older than 2 years

## Summary

Adds an early return condition to `pause_payouts_for_seller_based_on_recent_failures!` method to skip automatic payout pausing for sellers whose accounts were created more than 2 years ago. This addresses an issue where VIP sellers (typically established, high-volume sellers) were having their payouts incorrectly paused due to legitimate high transaction volumes triggering the fraud detection system.

**Changes:**
- Added single line early return: `return if seller.created_at < 2.years.ago`
- Added comprehensive test coverage for different account age scenarios
- Tests verify sellers >2 years are protected, =2 years still get flagged, <2 years work normally

## Review & Testing Checklist for Human

- [ ] **Verify business logic threshold**: Confirm whether accounts exactly 2 years old should be protected (current logic uses `<` so they still get flagged)
- [ ] **Test null safety**: Verify behavior when `seller` is nil (Purchase model shows `optional: true` - this could cause crashes)
- [ ] **Edge case testing**: Test accounts created exactly 2 years ago vs 2 years + 1 day to verify boundary conditions
- [ ] **End-to-end verification**: Test with actual purchase failure scenarios to ensure established sellers are protected while fraud detection still works for newer accounts
- [ ] **Monitor production impact**: After deployment, monitor for any unintended consequences on existing seller populations

**Recommended test plan**: Create test scenarios with sellers of different account ages and high failure volumes to verify only newer accounts get payouts paused.

### Notes

- **Context**: Requested after VIP sellers (Sam9y, Hypermatic, David Barnett) had payouts incorrectly paused
- **Risk**: Could not test locally due to database connectivity issues - CI and manual testing critical
- **Business impact**: Protects established sellers from false positives while maintaining fraud protection
- **Implementation**: Simple but high-impact change to fraud detection system
- **Potential null pointer**: Need to verify seller is always present when this method is called

2572635660,300,Fixed external PayPal API request when loading dashboard,daniellockyer,964245,closed,2025-06-06T06:50:23Z,2025-06-06T07:20:25Z,2025-06-06T07:20:24Z,https://api.github.com/repos/antiwork/gumroad,https://github.com/antiwork/gumroad/pull/300,"fix https://github.com/antiwork/gumroad/issues/274

- when loading the dashboard, if the user has PayPal payouts configured, we'd make a call to the PayPal API
- however, the code never used the value returned from the API because a different codepath gets triggered first
- as a result, we can re-arrange the code to skip that API request and save 500ms from dashboard load time

- since the PR above, we've been including the balance/stats directly into the page instead of relying on loading them via secondary API requests
- as a result, we're currently loading 4 different pages and not even using the result
- some of these requests are even just returning HTML because they don't have JSON equivalents
- we can do away with that and simplify the code in the process

  - Simplified the statistics display by removing asynchronous fetching and progress indicators. The statistic value is now displayed directly from the provided value.
  - Removed clickable links and URL-based navigation from the statistics components on the dashboard.
  - Updated font sizing and tooltip support for improved readability and usability.

2614908283,419,Fix hyperlink for 'Discount code' in customer dashboard help article,devin-ai-integration[bot],158243242,closed,2025-06-24T12:40:33Z,2025-06-24T14:58:03Z,2025-06-24T14:58:03Z,https://api.github.com/repos/antiwork/gumroad,https://github.com/antiwork/gumroad/pull/419,"# Fix hyperlink for 'Discount code' in customer dashboard help article

## Summary
Updated the hyperlink for ""Discount code"" text in the customer dashboard help article (article 268) to point to the correct discount codes help article URL.

## Changes Made
- Modified `app/views/help_center/articles/contents/_268-customer-dashboard.html.erb`
- Changed the href from `128-creating-offer-codes.html` to `https://gumroad.com/help/article/128-discount-codes`
- The text ""Discount code"" now correctly links to the discount codes help article

## Context
This change was requested via Slack to ensure the ""Discount codes"" hyperlink in the sentence ""Right below the product title, you're able to see if a Customer found this product via Discover or if a Discount code was used."" points to the correct help article about discount codes.

## Testing Transparency

### What I Actually Checked
- ✅ Verified the target file exists and contains the expected content
- ✅ Confirmed the sentence and text to be hyperlinked
- ✅ Updated the href attribute to use the correct URL format
- ✅ Verified the change was applied correctly in the file

### What I Did Not Check
- ❌ Did not test the actual link functionality in a browser
- ❌ Did not run the Rails application locally to verify HTML output
- ❌ Did not run any lint checks or tests for the application

## Review Checklist
Please verify:
- [ ] The hyperlink points to the correct discount codes help article
- [ ] The link is functional when the help center is accessed
- [ ] The HTML output renders correctly in the help center

On a high level:

**Rails**

- **MIME Types**: Registers `.smil` and `.m3u8` formats.
  - I've tested this in a branch app to make sure it doesn't interfere with existing routes
- **Streaming Endpoints**:
  - `GET /product_review_videos/:id/stream.smil`: returns SMIL playlist.
  - `GET /product_review_videos/:id/streaming_urls.json`: returns SMIL and signed download URLs.
- **Authorization**: Only approved videos or users related to the purchase can access streaming URLs (`ProductReviewVideoPolicy#stream?`).
- **Thumbnails**:
  - Adds `VideoFile::HasThumbnail` concern with validations and `:preview` variant (1280x720).
  - Adds `#thumbnail_url` helper.
  - This mostly follows existing pattern in `ProductFile`. With consolidate these two.
- **Model Changes**:
  - Adds `user_id` to `video_files`.
  - Adds `ProductReview#approved_video` and `.visible_on_product_page` scope.

**React**

- **`ReviewVideoPlayer`**:
  - Fetches streaming URLs on-demand.
  - Lazily loads and initializes JW Player.
  - Displays a thumbnail with a play button and loading state.

2446502497,79,Fix validation issue that prevented uploading covers on new Calls,s3ththompson,970121,closed,2025-04-08T17:12:58Z,2025-04-09T17:50:10Z,2025-04-09T17:50:10Z,https://api.github.com/repos/antiwork/gumroad,https://github.com/antiwork/gumroad/pull/79,"### What

Fixes a validation issue that prevented covers from being uploaded to new Call products.

Steps to reproduce:
- Create a new Call product
- Attempt to upload a cover image
- Fails with  ""Could not process your preview, please try again.""

### Why

Uploading a cover created a new asset preview, which in turn triggered the `reset_moderated_by_iffy_flag` action on the product. Updating the `moderated_by_iffy` flag on the product required it to pass validation. In the case of a new Call, validation failed because the user had not yet added a duration (`calls_must_have_at_least_one_duration`).

The fix is to update the `moderated_by_iffy` flag on the product without triggering validations and callbacks. This better reflect the intent of the action and preserves the expectation that products are not validated until the first time the user saves them.",Human,Ruby,7803.0,1470.0,https://github.com/antiwork/gumroad,antiwork/gumroad,human

> Error out when approving an invoice if there are not enough options for the contractor to be vested

This PR addresses:
- invoice submission handled gracefully if not enough options remain to be vested in the current allocated equity grant for a worker
- adds an alert on the admin invoices list when there are contractors with pending equity grant creation
- fixes a bug where invoices were payable for contractors not having an approved equity allocation for the year
- default to `10,000` options for new equity grants
- move equity split slider under the new invoice page

2621043364,414,Remove redundant validation check in invoice service,devin-ai-integration[bot],158243242,closed,2025-06-26T12:17:06Z,2025-06-26T12:35:44Z,2025-06-26T12:35:44Z,https://api.github.com/repos/antiwork/flexile,https://github.com/antiwork/flexile/pull/414,"
# Remove redundant validation check in invoice service

## Summary

This PR fixes HTTP 422 errors when submitting invoices by removing a redundant validation check in `CreateOrUpdateInvoiceService`. The service was performing an `all_values_present` check that duplicated model-level validations, causing generic ""Please input all values"" errors instead of the more specific model validation messages like ""Invoice line items description can't be blank"".

**Changes made:**
- Removed lines 16-21 in `CreateOrUpdateInvoiceService` containing the redundant `all_values_present` validation
- Updated test expectations in shared example group to expect the actual model validation error message
- Both RSpec test failures are now resolved

## Review & Testing Checklist for Human

- [ ] **Verify model validations are sufficient** - Confirm that `InvoiceLineItem` model validations properly handle all the validation cases that were previously covered by the service-level check
- [ ] **Test invoice submission end-to-end** - Submit an invoice with missing/empty description field via the frontend to ensure the error message is user-friendly and actionable
- [ ] **Check for other dependencies** - Search codebase for any other places that might expect or handle the ""Please input all values"" error message
- [ ] **Verify error message consistency** - Ensure the new error message ""Invoice line items description can't be blank"" matches the pattern of other validation errors in the system

**Recommended test plan:** Try submitting the original failing invoice payload `{""invoice"":{""invoice_date"":""2025-06-26""},""invoice_line_items"":[{""description"":""-"",""pay_rate_in_subunits"":1200000,""quantity"":1,""hourly"":false}]}` and verify it now returns a helpful error message instead of HTTP 422 with generic text.

### Notes

- The Playwright test failure in CI is unrelated to this change (tax settings UI issue)
- This change should improve user experience by providing more specific error messages
- The removed validation was checking `item.values.all?(&:present?)` which was too broad and prevented proper model validation errors from surfacing

The error `undefined method 'currency' for nil` happened when the job attempted to process dividend payments for investors who had completed tax verification but had not yet added a bank account for receiving dividends.

The fix involves adding a check for `user.bank_account_for_dividends.nil?` to the early return condition within the job's perform method.

2520323493,298,Remove pull_request_target from CI to fix rspec issues,MayaRainer,19721695,closed,2025-05-14T20:49:10Z,2025-05-15T01:34:10Z,2025-05-15T01:34:10Z,https://api.github.com/repos/antiwork/flexile,https://github.com/antiwork/flexile/pull/298,"In #87, we changed the CI scripts' trigger from `push` to `pull_request_target` in order to more easily be able to run external contributors' workflows with our secrets. Unfortunately, GitHub does not provide a good solution for this, and the one we ended up using has been causing lots of issues with Rspec (like [this one](https://github.com/antiwork/flexile/actions/runs/15008154337/job/42171663206), where it tries to use the config and list of tests from `main` on the feature branch).

Thus, as a short-term solution, this PR removes the `pull_request_target` trigger. This will mean OSS contributors have to set up the secrets (that they also need locally to run the app) in their forks for CI to be able to run on their PRs. Alternatively, we can test them locally as needed. Either way, once secrets are no longer required to run tests, this will be the best and simplest solution.

### Release Notes

<details>
<summary>pnpm/pnpm (pnpm)</summary>

### [`v10.6.4`](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/releases/tag/v10.6.4): pnpm 10.6.4

[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/compare/v10.6.3...v10.6.4)

#### Patch Changes

-   Fix `pnpm dlx` with `--allow-build` flag [#&#8203;9263](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9263).
-   Invalid Node.js version in `use-node-version` should not cause pnpm itself to break [#&#8203;9276](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9276).
-   The max amount of workers running for linking packages from the store has been reduced to 4 to achieve optimal results [#&#8203;9286](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9286). The workers are performing many file system operations, so increasing the number of CPUs doesn't help performance after some point.

Updates the `selectComboboxOption` helper in `e2e/helpers/index.ts` to use `.first()` when selecting a combobox option.

## Reason

The previous locator `page.getByRole(""option"", { name: option, exact: true })` could fail or lead to flaky tests if multiple options with the exact same text exist in a combobox. By adding `.first()`, we ensure that Playwright clicks the first matching option it finds, making the selection deterministic and the helper function more robust.",Human,Ruby,765.0,361.0,https://github.com/antiwork/flexile,antiwork/flexile,human

[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/alexrudall/ruby-openai/compare/v7.4.0...v8.0.0)

##### Added

-   Add Responses endpoints - thanks to my excellent colleague [@&#8203;simonx1](https://redirect.github.com/simonx1) for your work on this!
-   Add docs for the Deepseek chat API.
-   Add Models#delete - thanks to [bennysghost](https://redirect.github.com/bennysghost).

##### Fixed

-   \[BREAKING] Try to JSON parse everything. If it fails, fall back gracefully to returning the raw response. Thank you to [@&#8203;gregszero](https://redirect.github.com/gregszero) and the many others who raised this issue.
-   \[BREAKING] An unknown file type will no longer prevent file upload, but instead raise a warning.
-   \[BREAKING] ruby-openai longer requires ""faraday/multipart"" for Faraday 1 users (Faraday 1 already includes it and it was causing a warning). Thanks to [ajGingrich](https://redirect.github.com/ajGingrich) for raising this!
-   Add `user_data` and `evals` as options for known File types - thank you to [jontec](https://redirect.github.com/jontec) for this fix!
-   Fix a syntax ambiguity in Client.rb - thank you to [viralpraxis](https://redirect.github.com/viralpraxis).

##### Removed

-   \[BREAKING] Backwards compatibility for `require ""ruby/openai""` is removed - from v8 on you MUST use `require ""openai""`. This fixes a deprecation warning with Ruby 3.4. Thanks to [@&#8203;ndemianc](https://redirect.github.com/ndemianc) for this PR.
-   \[BREAKING] Removed support for Ruby 2.6. ruby-openai may still work with this version but it's no longer supported.
-   Removed the 'OpenAI-Beta' header from Batches API requests.

2447357573,91,Refactor document signing mechanism to be independent of legal names,raulpopadineti,1855287,closed,2025-04-09T03:07:33Z,2025-04-14T18:53:38Z,2025-04-14T18:53:38Z,https://api.github.com/repos/antiwork/flexile,https://github.com/antiwork/flexile/pull/91,"## Refactor Document Signing for Flexibility and Fix Legal Name Dependency

This pull request addresses a bug where document signing (e.g., consulting agreements) would fail if any signing party did not have a legal name set in their profile. It also refactors the underlying document signature mechanism to be more flexible and robustly support multiple signatories.

### Key Changes:

#### Introduce `document_signatures` Join Table:
- Created a new join table, `document_signatures`, to link documents and users.
- Replaces the previous approach of storing signatures directly on the document model (e.g., `contractor_signature`, `administrator_signature`).
- Each record in `document_signatures` represents a required signatory for a document.
  - Migration: `apps/rails/db/migrate/20250409021342_create_new_document_signatures.rb`

#### Update Document Model:
- Removed reliance on specific fields like `contractor_signature` and `administrator_signature`.
- Updated validation logic (`fully_signed`) to use the count of associated records in the `document_signatures` table to determine if a document is fully signed.
  - Model changes: `apps/rails/app/models/document.rb`
- **TODO/Potential Follow-up**: Remove legacy columns (`contractor_signature`, `administrator_signature`, `company_administrator_id`, `company_contractor_id`, `completed_at`) and potentially add `signed_at` to the `document_signatures` table for cleaner implementation.

#### Update Factories and Frontend:
- Adjusted document factories to support the new `document_signatures` association.
- Updated frontend TypeScript code handling document signatures to align with backend changes.

### Fixes:
- Resolves the issue where missing legal names blocked document signing.
- Makes the signing process independent of user profile details like legal names.
- Provides a scalable structure for documents with varying numbers of signatories.",Human,Ruby,765.0,361.0,https://github.com/antiwork/flexile,antiwork/flexile,human

[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/compare/v10.7.1...v10.8.0)

##### Minor Changes

-   **Experimental.** A new hook is supported for updating configuration settings. The hook can be provided via `.pnpmfile.cjs`. For example:

    ```js
    module.exports = {
      hooks: {
        updateConfig: (config) => ({
          ...config,
          nodeLinker: ""hoisted"",
        }),
      },
    };
    ```

##### Patch Changes

-   Do not hang indefinitely, when there is a glob that starts with `!/` in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`. This fixes a regression introduced by [#&#8203;9169](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/9169).
-   `pnpm audit --fix` should update the overrides in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`.
-   `pnpm link` should update overrides in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, not in `package.json` [#&#8203;9365](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/9365).

2611345174,402,Fix desktop layout in CardContent on invoices page,devin-ai-integration[bot],158243242,closed,2025-06-23T11:26:20Z,2025-06-23T14:06:40Z,2025-06-23T14:06:40Z,https://api.github.com/repos/antiwork/flexile,https://github.com/antiwork/flexile/pull/402,"# Fix desktop layout in CardContent on invoices page

This PR fixes the desktop layout issue in the `CardContent` component on the `/invoices` page where form fields were stacking vertically instead of displaying in the intended two-column layout.

## Changes Made

- Changed grid layout from `lg:grid-cols-[1fr_auto_1fr]` to `lg:grid-cols-2` for consistent two-column desktop layout
- Moved equity compensation field into the left column alongside other form fields (Rate, Hours/Qty, Invoice date)
- Removed separators that were designed for the problematic three-column layout
- Ensures layout works consistently whether equity compensation is enabled or disabled

## Problem Solved

The original three-column grid layout (`lg:grid-cols-[1fr_auto_1fr]`) was breaking when the equity compensation section was conditionally rendered. When equity compensation was disabled, there were only two elements in a three-column grid, causing improper alignment and vertical stacking instead of the intended horizontal layout.

## Testing

- ✅ Lint checks passed with no ESLint warnings or errors
- ⚠️ Local testing was limited due to Redis connection issues in the development environment
- Layout changes are straightforward CSS grid modifications that should work as expected

## Screenshots

Before: Form fields stacked vertically
After: Two-column layout with form fields on left, total amount on right (as intended in design)

### Release Notes

<details>
<summary>rails/rails (rails)</summary>

### [`v8.0.2`](https://redirect.github.com/rails/rails/releases/tag/v8.0.2): 8.0.2

[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/rails/rails/compare/v8.0.1...v8.0.2)

#### Active Support

-   Fix setting `to_time_preserves_timezone` from `new_framework_defaults_8_0.rb`.

    *fatkodima*

-   Fix Active Support Cache `fetch_multi` when local store is active.

    `fetch_multi` now properly yield to the provided block for missing entries
    that have been recorded as such in the local store.

    *Jean Boussier*

-   Fix execution wrapping to report all exceptions, including `Exception`.

    If a more serious error like `SystemStackError` or `NoMemoryError` happens,
    the error reporter should be able to report these kinds of exceptions.

    *Gannon McGibbon*

-   Fix `RedisCacheStore` and `MemCacheStore` to also handle connection pool related errors.

    These errors are rescued and reported to `Rails.error`.

    *Jean Boussier*

-   Fix `ActiveSupport::Cache#read_multi` to respect version expiry when using local cache.

    *zzak*

-   Fix `ActiveSupport::MessageVerifier` and `ActiveSupport::MessageEncryptor` configuration of `on_rotation` callback.

    ```ruby
    verifier.rotate(old_secret).on_rotation { ... }
    ```

    Now both work as documented.

    *Jean Boussier*

-   Fix `ActiveSupport::MessageVerifier` to always be able to verify both URL-safe and URL-unsafe payloads.

    This is to allow transitioning seemlessly from either configuration without immediately invalidating
    all previously generated signed messages.

    *Jean Boussier*, *Florent Beaurain*, *Ali Sepehri*

-   Fix `cache.fetch` to honor the provided expiry when `:race_condition_ttl` is used.

    ```ruby
    cache.fetch(""key"", expires_in: 1.hour, race_condition_ttl: 5.second) do
      ""something""
    end
    ```

    In the above example, the final cache entry would have a 10 seconds TTL instead
    of the requested 1 hour.

    *Dhia*

-   Better handle procs with splat arguments in `set_callback`.

    *Radamés Roriz*

-   Fix `String#mb_chars` to not mutate the receiver.

    Previously it would call `force_encoding` on the receiver,
    now it dups the receiver first.

    *Jean Boussier*

-   Improve `ErrorSubscriber` to also mark error causes as reported.

    This avoid some cases of errors being reported twice, notably in views because of how
    errors are wrapped in `ActionView::Template::Error`.

    *Jean Boussier*

-   Fix `Module#module_parent_name` to return the correct name after the module has been named.

    When called on an anonymous module, the return value wouldn't change after the module was given a name
    later by being assigned to a constant.

    ```ruby
    mod = Module.new
    mod.module_parent_name # => ""Object""
    MyModule::Something = mod
    mod.module_parent_name # => ""MyModule""
    ```

    *Jean Boussier*

#### Active Model

-   No changes.

#### Active Record

-   Fix inverting `rename_enum_value` when `:from`/`:to` are provided.

    *fatkodima*

-   Prevent persisting invalid record.

    *Edouard Chin*

-   Fix inverting `drop_table` without options.

    *fatkodima*

-   Fix count with group by qualified name on loaded relation.

    *Ryuta Kamizono*

-   Fix `sum` with qualified name on loaded relation.

    *Chris Gunther*

-   The SQLite3 adapter quotes non-finite Numeric values like ""Infinity"" and ""NaN"".

    *Mike Dalessio*

-   Handle libpq returning a database version of 0 on no/bad connection in `PostgreSQLAdapter`.

    Before, this version would be cached and an error would be raised during connection configuration when
    comparing it with the minimum required version for the adapter. This meant that the connection could
    never be successfully configured on subsequent reconnection attempts.

    Now, this is treated as a connection failure consistent with libpq, raising a `ActiveRecord::ConnectionFailed`
    and ensuring the version isn't cached, which allows the version to be retrieved on the next connection attempt.

    *Joshua Young*, *Rian McGuire*

-   Fix error handling during connection configuration.

    Active Record wasn't properly handling errors during the connection configuration phase.
    This could lead to a partially configured connection being used, resulting in various exceptions,
    the most common being with the PostgreSQLAdapter raising ` undefined method  `key?' for nil`or`TypeError: wrong argument type nil (expected PG::TypeMap)\`.

    *Jean Boussier*

-   Fix a case where a non-retryable query could be marked retryable.

    *Hartley McGuire*

-   Handle circular references when autosaving associations.

    *zzak*

-   PoolConfig no longer keeps a reference to the connection class.

    Keeping a reference to the class caused subtle issues when combined with reloading in
    development. Fixes [#&#8203;54343](https://redirect.github.com/rails/rails/issues/54343).

    *Mike Dalessio*

-   Fix SQL notifications sometimes not sent when using async queries.

    ```ruby
    Post.async_count
    ActiveSupport::Notifications.subscribed(->(*) { ""Will never reach here"" }) do
      Post.count
    end
    ```

    In rare circumstances and under the right race condition, Active Support notifications
    would no longer be dispatched after using an asynchronous query.
    This is now fixed.

    *Edouard Chin*

-   Fix support for PostgreSQL enum types with commas in their name.

    *Arthur Hess*

-   Fix inserts on MySQL with no RETURNING support for a table with multiple auto populated columns.

    *Nikita Vasilevsky*

-   Fix joining on a scoped association with string joins and bind parameters.

    ```ruby
    class Instructor < ActiveRecord::Base
      has_many :instructor_roles, -> { active }
    end

    class InstructorRole < ActiveRecord::Base
      scope :active, -> {
        joins(""JOIN students ON instructor_roles.student_id = students.id"")
        .where(students { status: 1 })
      }
    end

    Instructor.joins(:instructor_roles).first
    ```

    The above example would result in `ActiveRecord::StatementInvalid` because the
    `active` scope bind parameters would be lost.

    *Jean Boussier*

-   Fix a potential race condition with system tests and transactional fixtures.

    *Sjoerd Lagarde*

-   Fix autosave associations to no longer validated unmodified associated records.

    Active Record was incorrectly performing validation on associated record that
    weren't created nor modified as part of the transaction:

    ```ruby
    Post.create!(author: User.find(1)) # Fail if user is invalid
    ```

    *Jean Boussier*

-   Remember when a database connection has recently been verified (for
    two seconds, by default), to avoid repeated reverifications during a
    single request.

    This should recreate a similar rate of verification as in Rails 7.1,
    where connections are leased for the duration of a request, and thus
    only verified once.

    *Matthew Draper*

#### Action View

-   Respect `html_options[:form]` when `collection_checkboxes` generates the
    hidden `<input>`.

    *Riccardo Odone*

-   Layouts have access to local variables passed to `render`.

    This fixes [#&#8203;31680](https://redirect.github.com/rails/rails/issues/31680) which was a regression in Rails 5.1.

    *Mike Dalessio*

-   Argument errors related to strict locals in templates now raise an
    `ActionView::StrictLocalsError`, and all other argument errors are reraised as-is.

    Previously, any `ArgumentError` raised during template rendering was swallowed during strict
    local error handling, so that an `ArgumentError` unrelated to strict locals (e.g., a helper
    method invoked with incorrect arguments) would be replaced by a similar `ArgumentError` with an
    unrelated backtrace, making it difficult to debug templates.

    Now, any `ArgumentError` unrelated to strict locals is reraised, preserving the original
    backtrace for developers.

    Also note that `ActionView::StrictLocalsError` is a subclass of `ArgumentError`, so any existing
    code that rescues `ArgumentError` will continue to work.

    Fixes [#&#8203;52227](https://redirect.github.com/rails/rails/issues/52227).

    *Mike Dalessio*

-   Fix stack overflow error in dependency tracker when dealing with circular dependencies

    *Jean Boussier*

#### Action Pack

-   Improve `with_routing` test helper to not rebuild the middleware stack.

    Otherwise some middleware configuration could be lost.

    *Édouard Chin*

-   Add resource name to the `ArgumentError` that's raised when invalid `:only` or `:except` options are given to `#resource` or `#resources`

    This makes it easier to locate the source of the problem, especially for routes drawn by gems.

    Before:

        :only and :except must include only [:index, :create, :new, :show, :update, :destroy, :edit], but also included [:foo, :bar]

    After:

        Route `resources :products` - :only and :except must include only [:index, :create, :new, :show, :update, :destroy, :edit], but also included [:foo, :bar]

    *Jeremy Green*

-   Fix `url_for` to handle `:path_params` gracefully when it's not a `Hash`.

    Prevents various security scanners from causing exceptions.

    *Martin Emde*

-   Fix `ActionDispatch::Executor` to unwrap exceptions like other error reporting middlewares.

    *Jean Boussier*

#### Active Job

-   No changes.

#### Action Mailer

-   No changes.

#### Action Cable

-   No changes.

#### Active Storage

-   A Blob will no longer autosave associated Attachment.

    This fixes an issue where a record with an attachment would have
    its dirty attributes reset, preventing your `after commit` callbacks
    on that record to behave as expected.

    Note that this change doesn't require any changes on your application
    and is supposed to be internal. Active Storage Attachment will continue
    to be autosaved (through a different relation).

    *Edouard-chin*

#### Action Mailbox

-   No changes.

#### Action Text

-   No changes.

#### Railties

-   Fix Rails console to load routes.

    Otherwise `*_path` and `*url` methods are missing on the `app` object.

    *Édouard Chin*

-   Update `rails new --minimal` option

    Extend the `--minimal` flag to exclude recently added features:
    `skip_brakeman`, `skip_ci`, `skip_docker`, `skip_kamal`, `skip_rubocop`, `skip_solid` and `skip_thruster`.

    *eelcoj*

-   Use `secret_key_base` from ENV or credentials when present locally.

    When ENV\[""SECRET_KEY_BASE""] or
    `Rails.application.credentials.secret_key_base` is set for test or
    development, it is used for the `Rails.config.secret_key_base`,
    instead of generating a `tmp/local_secret.txt` file.

    *Petrik de Heus*

#### Guides

-   No changes.

[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/sidekiq/sidekiq/compare/v8.0.0...v8.0.1)

-   Relax Redis requirement to 7.0 for compatibility with AWS and Ubuntu 24.04 LTS. \[[#&#8203;6630](https://redirect.github.com/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/6630)]

### [`v8.0.0`](https://redirect.github.com/sidekiq/sidekiq/blob/HEAD/Changes.md#800)

[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/sidekiq/sidekiq/compare/v7.3.9...v8.0.0)

-   **WARNING** The underlying class name for Active Jobs has changed from `ActiveJob::QueueAdapters::SidekiqAdapter::JobWrapper` to `Sidekiq::ActiveJob::Wrapper`.
    The old name will still work in 8.x.
-   **WARNING** The `created_at`, `enqueued_at`, `failed_at` and `retried_at` attributes are now stored as epoch milliseconds, rather than epoch floats.
    This is meant to avoid precision issues with JSON and JavaScript's 53-bit Floats.
    Example: `""created_at"" => 1234567890.123456` -> `""created_at"" => 1234567890123`.
-   **NEW FEATURE** Job Profiling is now supported with [Vernier](https://vernier.prof)
    which makes it really easy to performance tune your slow jobs.
    The Web UI contains a new **Profiles** tab to view any collected profile data.
    Please read the new [Profiling](https://redirect.github.com/sidekiq/sidekiq/wiki/Profiling) wiki page for details.
-   **NEW FEATURE** Job Metrics now store up to 72 hours of data and the Web UI allows display of 24/48/72 hours. \[[#&#8203;6614](https://redirect.github.com/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/6614)]
-   CurrentAttribute support now uses `ActiveJob::Arguments` to serialize the context object, supporting Symbols and GlobalID.
    The change should be backwards compatible. \[[#&#8203;6510](https://redirect.github.com/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/6510)]
-   Freshen up `Sidekiq::Web` to simplify the code and improve security \[[#&#8203;6532](https://redirect.github.com/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/6532)]

-   Add `on_cancel` callback for iterable jobs \[[#&#8203;6607](https://redirect.github.com/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/6607)]
-   Add `cursor` reader to get the current cursor inside iterable jobs \[[#&#8203;6606](https://redirect.github.com/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/6606)]
-   Default error logging has been modified to use Ruby's `Exception#detailed_message` and `#full_message` APIs.
-   CI now runs against Redis, Dragonfly and Valkey.
-   Job tags now allow custom CSS display \[[#&#8203;6595](https://redirect.github.com/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/6595)]
-   The Web UI's language picker now shows options in the native language
-   Remove global variable usage within the codebase
-   Colorize and adjust logging for easier reading
-   Adjust Sidekiq's default thread priority to -1 for a 50ms timeslice.
    This can help avoid TimeoutErrors when Sidekiq is overloaded. \[[#&#8203;6543](https://redirect.github.com/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/6543)]
-   Use `Logger#with_level`, remove Sidekiq's custom impl
-   Remove `base64` gem dependency
-   Support: (Dragonfly 1.27+, Valkey 7.2+, Redis 7.2+), Ruby 3.2+, Rails 7.0+

### GitHub Vulnerability Alerts

#### [CVE-2025-29927](https://redirect.github.com/vercel/next.js/security/advisories/GHSA-f82v-jwr5-mffw)

# Impact
It is possible to bypass authorization checks within a Next.js application, if the authorization check occurs in middleware.

# Patches
* For Next.js 15.x, this issue is fixed in `15.2.3`
* For Next.js 14.x, this issue is fixed in `14.2.25`
* For Next.js 13.x, this issue is fixed in `13.5.9`
* For Next.js 12.x, this issue is fixed in `12.3.5`
* For Next.js 11.x, consult the below workaround.

_Note: Next.js deployments hosted on Vercel are automatically protected against this vulnerability._

# Workaround
If patching to a safe version is infeasible, it is recommend that you prevent external user requests which contain the `x-middleware-subrequest` header from reaching your Next.js application.

## Summary
Removed the ""Set up your company"" step from the administrator onboarding flow as requested. The company details form fields (legal name, street address, city, state, ZIP code) are now collected in the administrator settings details page instead.

## Changes Made
- ✅ Removed ""Company details"" from the onboarding steps array in `frontend/app/companies/[companyId]/administrator/onboarding/index.ts`
- ✅ Deleted the entire company details onboarding page directory (`frontend/app/companies/[companyId]/administrator/onboarding/details/`)
- ✅ Updated administrator settings details page to include company address fields that were previously in onboarding
- ✅ Removed the e2e test file for the deleted onboarding step
- ✅ Updated form validation and field labels to match the original onboarding form

## Technical Details
- The onboarding flow now goes directly from ""Signup"" to ""Bank account"" (2 steps instead of 3)
- Company address fields are now collected via the TRPC `companies.update` mutation in settings
- The settings page already had the necessary backend support for these fields
- Maintained consistent form validation and user experience

## Testing
- [x] Code compiles without errors
- [x] Git history is clean with descriptive commit message
- [ ] Manual testing of onboarding flow (requires local dev environment)
- [ ] Manual testing of administrator settings page (requires local dev environment)

## Notes

### Release Notes

<details>
<summary>pnpm/pnpm (pnpm)</summary>

### [`v10.7.0`](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/blob/HEAD/pnpm/CHANGELOG.md#1070)

[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/compare/v10.6.5...v10.7.0)

##### Minor Changes

-   `pnpm config get` and `list` also show settings set in `pnpm-workspace.yaml` files [#&#8203;9316](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/9316).

-   It should be possible to use env variables in `pnpm-workspace.yaml` setting names and value.

-   Add an ability to patch dependencies by version ranges. Exact versions override version ranges, which in turn override name-only patches. Version range `*` is the same as name-only, except that patch application failure will not be ignored.

    For example:

    ```yaml
    patchedDependencies:
      foo: patches/foo-1.patch
      foo@^2.0.0: patches/foo-2.patch
      foo@2.1.0: patches/foo-3.patch
    ```

    The above configuration would apply `patches/foo-3.patch` to `foo@2.1.0`, `patches/foo-2.patch` to all `foo` versions which satisfy `^2.0.0` except `2.1.0`, and `patches/foo-1.patch` to the remaining `foo` versions.

    > \[!WARNING]
    > The version ranges should not overlap. If you want to specialize a sub range, make sure to exclude it from the other keys. For example:
    >
    > ```yaml
    > # pnpm-workspace.yaml
    > patchedDependencies:
    >   # the specialized sub range
    >   'foo@2.2.0-2.8.0': patches/foo.2.2.0-2.8.0.patch
    >   # the more general patch, excluding the sub range above
    >   'foo@>=2.0.0 <2.2.0 || >2.8.0': 'patches/foo.gte2.patch
    > ```
    >
    > In most cases, however, it's sufficient to just define an exact version to override the range.

-   `pnpm config set --location=project` saves the setting to a `pnpm-workspace.yaml` file if no `.npmrc` file is present in the directory [#&#8203;9316](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/9316).

-   Rename `pnpm.allowNonAppliedPatches` to `pnpm.allowUnusedPatches`. The old name is still supported but it would print a deprecation warning message.

-   Add `pnpm.ignorePatchFailures` to manage whether pnpm would ignore patch application failures.

    If `ignorePatchFailures` is not set, pnpm would throw an error when patches with exact versions or version ranges fail to apply, and it would ignore failures from name-only patches.

    If `ignorePatchFailures` is explicitly set to `false`, pnpm would throw an error when any type of patch fails to apply.

    If `ignorePatchFailures` is explicitly set to `true`, pnpm would print a warning when any type of patch fails to apply.

##### Patch Changes

-   Remove dependency paths from audit output to prevent out-of-memory errors [#&#8203;9280](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9280).

##### ⚠️ Other Breaking changes in the SDK

-   [#&#8203;2277](https://redirect.github.com/stripe/stripe-node/pull/2277) Swap Stripe.webhooks from a factory function to a static property
    -   `Stripe.webhooks` and `Stripe().webhooks` are no longer functions (just plain objects)
        -   if you were already treating those properties as plain objects (per the types), then you can ignore this change
        -   if you were calling `Stripe.webhooks().someMethod()`, you should use `Stripe.webhooks.someMethod()` instead
        -   there shouldn't be user-facing functionality changing, just a slight breaking change in our internal organization

### [`v1.0.2`](https://redirect.github.com/belav/csharpier/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#102)

[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/belav/csharpier/compare/1.0.1...1.0.2)

#### What's Changed

##### Performance issues when supporting .gitignore. [#&#8203;1588](https://redirect.github.com/belav/csharpier/issues/1588)

CSharpier was using a naive algorithm for parsing and evaluating gitignore rules that caused significant perfomance issues. [@&#8203;kevinboss](https://redirect.github.com/kevinboss) reworked the implementation to drastically increate performance.

##### Exclude `bin/` and `obj/` directory content from xml formatting [#&#8203;1600](https://redirect.github.com/belav/csharpier/issues/1600)

CSharpier now excludes all files in `bin/` and `obj/` by default.

##### Error on syntactically valid conditional with `is` [#&#8203;1612](https://redirect.github.com/belav/csharpier/issues/1612)

The following c# is valid and compiles with `9.0.300+`. CSharpier was updated to properly parse it.

```c#
var x = y is y ? [] : z ?? [];
```

##### Xml formatting with comments in text element inserts extra new lines [#&#8203;1607](https://redirect.github.com/belav/csharpier/issues/1607)

CSharpier has some issues with formatting text that contained xml comments. That has been improved.

Input & expected output

```xml
<NoWarn>
  CA1031; <!-- Since this is not a library project, catching general exceptions is OK -->
  IDE0005; <!-- Allow unused usings -->
</NoWarn>
```

1.0.1

```xml
<NoWarn
    >
      CA1031;
    <!-- Since this is not a library project, catching general exceptions is OK -->

    
      IDE0005;
    <!-- Allow unused usings -->
</NoWarn>

```

##### Inconsistent formatting of single-line lambda expressions [#&#8203;1594](https://redirect.github.com/belav/csharpier/issues/1594)

CSharpier `1.0.0` introduced a regression that caused the following formatting. This is now working as expected.

```c#
// input & expected output
        CallMethod(() => CallAnotherMethod______________________________________________________());
        CallMethod(() =>
            CallAnotherMethod______________________________________________________1()
        );
        CallMethod(() =>
            CallAnotherMethod______________________________________________________12()
        );
        CallMethod(() =>
            CallAnotherMethod______________________________________________________123()
        );

// 1.0.0
        CallMethod(() => CallAnotherMethod______________________________________________________());
        CallMethod(() => CallAnotherMethod______________________________________________________1()
        );
        CallMethod(() => CallAnotherMethod______________________________________________________12()
        );
        CallMethod(() =>
            CallAnotherMethod______________________________________________________123()
        );
```

This pull request updates the Espressif ESP-IDF examples in the wolfMQTT repository to improve compatibility with the latest Managed Components system. The changes focus on two main example projects: `AWS_IoT_MQTT` and `wolfmqtt_template`.

Updates Espressif examples to work properly with the [ESP Registry Managed Components for wolfSSL](https://components.espressif.com/components?q=namespace:wolfssl).

These are the as-published files for the [gojimmypi/mywolfmqtt v1.18.0-preview7c](https://components-staging.espressif.com/components/gojimmypi/mywolfmqtt/versions/1.18.0-preview7c?language=en)


## Key Changes

### 1. Build System Improvements
- Added new `component.mk` files for better compatibility with ESP-IDF build system
- Updated `CMakeLists.txt` files with improved component search logic
- Added comprehensive Kconfig files with extensive configuration options
- Reduced main task stack size in sdkconfig.defaults from 55500 to 10500
- Added partition table configuration for single app large partition
- Added `include.am` files for better integration with autotools build system

### 2. Component Integration Enhancements
- Improved wolfSSL and wolfMQTT component integration
- Added better detection of wolfSSL/wolfMQTT source directories
- Enhanced component dependency management
- Added support for ESP-IDF component registry
- Improved handling of multiple component instances (local vs ESP-IDF)
- Added compatibility with different ESP-IDF RTOS directory structures

### 3. Documentation Updates
- Added detailed README.md files in example directories
- Updated existing README.md files with improved instructions
- Added documentation for Managed Component usage
- Updated links to related examples and resources
- Added placeholder README files for example code directories

### 4. Code Quality Improvements
- Updated copyright notices from 2023 to 2025
- Fixed license headers to correctly identify files as part of wolfMQTT (not wolfSSL)
- Added git information macros for better version tracking
- Added debugging and configuration options

### 5. Espressif-Specific Enhancements
- Added hardware acceleration configuration options
- Improved ESP-TLS integration
- Added certificate bundle configuration
- Added support for different ESP-IDF versions
- Enhanced WiFi and time helper utilities

## Summary

This PR significantly improves the Espressif ESP-IDF examples for wolfMQTT by enhancing build system integration, adding comprehensive configuration options, improving documentation, and ensuring compatibility with the latest Espressif Managed Components system. These changes make it easier for users to integrate wolfMQTT into their Espressif ESP32 projects, particularly when using the ESP-IDF component registry.

## Schema Action
New Schema

## Schema Motivation
Adding a schema for structured extraction of lease agreements, supporting both commercial and residential lease documents.

Benefits:
- Standardizes lease agreement data extraction
- Captures comprehensive lease terms and conditions
- Flexible structure for different lease types

## Sample Document
[Sample Commercial Lease Agreement](https://storage.googleapis.com/sample-hub-data/real-estate.lease-agreement/sample_lease_doc_6.pdf)

Calls to `wolfSSL_CTX_SetMinEccKey_Sz(ctx, 521)` and `wolfSSL_SetMinEccKey_Sz(ssl, 521)` currently fails because 521 isn't divisible by 8. This PR removes the check. When the input keySz in bits is divisibly by 8, it sets the minumum to the result of the division. When it's not, rounds up the result. For eg `wolfSSL_CTX_SetMinEccKey_Sz(ctx, 521)` sets the minKeySz in bytes to 66

Adds GitHub action to test Apple specific CA cert functionality. Configuration sets `RSA_MIN_SIZE=2048` to comply with [Apple requirements](https://support.apple.com/en-us/103769). Disables cipher suite tests.

Adds new macro `WOLFSSL_TEST_APPLE_NATIVE_CERT_VALIDATION` to test system CA cert validation on Apple platforms. This macro allows the wolfSSL CA table to be unloaded and appends the CA certs to the list of Apple trusted certificates at run time. Enabling `WOLFSSL_TEST_APPLE_NATIVE_CERT_VALIDATION` allows the Apple native cert validation feature to be exercised by unit tests without actually adding CAs directly to the system cert store.

Checks CFErrorRef for errors other than ""Exceeds maximum validity period""

Modifies domain name check test to run without setting SYS_CA_CERTS. Addresses comment made in PR #8917. Macro guard to run if `OPENSSL_COMPATIBLE_DEFAULTS` is not defined. This causes the client to be set to `SSL_VERIFY_NONE`, rendering a domain name useless as it would not be checked.

Failing cipher suite tests, `--enable-openssl` and `--enable-opensslextra` will be addressed in future.

# Testing

Apple native cert validation tests

## Overview
This PR adds support for the Allora Network, enabling agents to fetch and utilize network inferences for various topics. The integration allows seamless access to Allora's predictive capabilities through a standardized connection interface.

## Features
- New `AlloraConnection` class implementing the `BaseConnection` interface
- Support for Allora API authentication and configuration
- Two primary actions:
  - `get-inference`: Fetch network inference for specific topics
  - `list-topics`: Retrieve available Allora Network topics
- Chain slug configuration with default testnet support
- Environment-based API key management

## Detailed Testing Steps

1. **API Key Setup**
   - Set the `ALLORA_API_KEY` in your `.env` file
   - To generate the API key, use the [Upshot Developer Portal](https://developer.upshot.xyz/signup)

2. **Basic Connection Test**
   ```bash
   configure-connection allora
   list-connections  # Verify Allora shows as configured
   ```

3. **Testing Inference Retrieval**
   ```bash
   # Direct action testing
   agent-action allora get-inference 1

# Automate release notes and version from GitHub releases

## Summary

This PR eliminates the need to manually maintain version numbers and release notes in the csproj file by automating them through GitHub releases. When a new release is created on GitHub, the workflow will now:

1. Extract the version number from the release tag (handling 'v' prefix automatically)
2. Use the release description as PackageReleaseNotes via a file-based approach to safely handle quotes and newlines
3. Pass these values to `dotnet pack` via MSBuild properties

The hardcoded `Version` and `PackageReleaseNotes` properties have been removed from the csproj file, making the release process much more streamlined.

**Key Changes:**
- Modified GitHub Actions workflow to extract version from `github.event.release.tag_name`
- Added safe release notes handling by writing to file first, then reading with `cat`
- Updated `dotnet pack` command to use MSBuild properties `-p:Version` and `-p:PackageReleaseNotes`
- Removed hardcoded version (2.7.0) and release notes (24 lines) from csproj

## Review & Testing Checklist for Human

- [ ] **🔴 CRITICAL: Test end-to-end release workflow** - Create a test release on GitHub with version tag (e.g., ""v2.8.0-test"") and verify the NuGet package is published with correct version and release notes extracted from the release
- [ ] **🟡 Test version tag extraction with edge cases** - Try different tag formats like ""v2.8.0"", ""2.8.0"", ""2.8.0-beta"", ""v2.8.0-rc1"" to ensure version extraction works correctly
- [ ] **🟡 Test release notes with problematic content** - Create a test release with release notes containing quotes, newlines, apostrophes, and special characters to ensure the file-based approach handles them safely
- [ ] **🟡 Verify NuGet package metadata** - After publishing, check the NuGet package on nuget.org to confirm version and release notes appear correctly in the package details
- [ ] **🟢 Confirm local builds still work** - Verify that local `dotnet build` and `dotnet pack` commands still work (they should use default version 1.0.0 without the properties)

### Notes

- **File-based approach**: The release notes are now written to `release-notes.txt` first, then read with `cat` to safely handle quotes, newlines, and other special characters that could break shell command parsing
- **Version extraction**: Handles the common 'v' prefix pattern (e.g., ""v2.8.0"" becomes ""2.8.0"") but should be tested with various tag formats
- **Local development impact**: Local builds will now use default version (1.0.0) since the MSBuild properties are only provided during release builds
- **Workflow isolation**: The release-specific steps only execute when `github.event_name == 'release'`, so they won't affect regular PR builds
- **Addresses feedback**: Updated based on @martinnormark's comment about safer PackageReleaseNotes handling

**⚠️ Important**: This PR changes the core release process and should be tested thoroughly with a test release before being used for production releases.

2621785298,432,Fix port number preservation in CSS import URI resolution,devin-ai-integration[bot],158243242,closed,2025-06-26T17:23:58Z,2025-06-26T17:57:27Z,2025-06-26T17:57:27Z,https://api.github.com/repos/milkshakesoftware/PreMailer.Net,https://github.com/milkshakesoftware/PreMailer.Net/pull/432,"
# Fix port number preservation in CSS import URI resolution

## Summary
Fixes issue #431 where port numbers were being discarded from URIs when resolving relative CSS imports since version 2.7.0. The bug was in the `GetBaseUri()` method in `ImportRuleCssSource.cs`, which explicitly set `Port = -1` to exclude port numbers when creating base URIs for resolving relative imports.

**Changes:**
- Removed the `Port = -1` assignment in `ImportRuleCssSource.GetBaseUri()` to preserve port numbers
- Added comprehensive test `ItShould_PreservePortNumber_WhenResolvingRelativeImports()` to verify the fix

**Impact:** This enables CSS imports to work correctly when the base stylesheet is served from a non-standard port (e.g., development servers on localhost:8080).

## Review & Testing Checklist for Human
- [x] **Verify the test demonstrates the actual bug** - Run the new test against the original code (before the fix) to confirm it fails
- [x] **Test with real CSS imports and port numbers** - Set up a development server on a non-standard port and verify CSS imports work end-to-end
- [x] **Investigate original intent** - Check git history/documentation to understand why port numbers were originally stripped - there may have been a legitimate reason

### Notes
- All 173 existing tests pass, indicating no regressions in current test coverage
- The fix is minimal and focused - only removes the problematic line that strips port numbers
- The new test follows existing patterns in the test suite using Mock<IWebDownloader>
- This change specifically affects relative CSS import resolution, not absolute URLs
